Sword Health,Active,Márcio Colunas,Founder and CSO at Sword Health,https://pt.linkedin.com/in/marciocolunas,Portugal,"Born in Chaves, Portugal, Márcio Colunas traces his passion for technology back to when he was just nine years old, as his elementary school got its first computer. During that time, he and his classmates explored all that early computing offered, including computer games and those iconic floppy disks of the '90s. This sparked his curiosity and led him to envision a career in programming—creating games that had to be as enjoyable to build as they were to play.

He pursued his studies in Computer and Telematics Engineering at the University of Aveiro, where his desire to improve lives through technology led him to co-found Sword Health, alongside Virgílio Bento. Together, they developed an AI-powered digital therapist to revolutionize musculoskeletal care, making world-class care accessible anytime, anywhere.

Initially focused on physical pain, Sword Health expanded into pelvic health and has since evolved into a comprehensive platform of solutions. With over 35 patents filed, more than $300 million raised from leading venture capital firms—including Khosla Ventures and General Catalyst— and a valuation of over $3 billion, Sword was recognized as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. by Inc. magazine in 2023 and awarded top spot on Fast Company’s 2024 World Changing Ideas list. 

Today, Márcio serves as the Chief Scientific Officer at Sword, leading the Research & Systems, Information Security, and Operations teams. Eager for knowledge, passionate about innovation, and a strong advocate for teamwork, he is known for his ability to simplify complex engineering challenges and think outside the box.

V is the founder and CEO of Sword Health, the leading company behind the world's first AI Healer that makes world-class care available anytime, anywhere, to anyone, while significantly reducing costs for healthcare organizations. Phoenix, Sword's AI Healer, has already treated more than 500,000 patients across three continents and delivered 6.5 million AI sessions across physical pain, women's health, and mental health, helping Sword's clients avoid nearly $1 billion in unnecessary healthcare costs.

Long version:

The vision behind Sword’s AI Healer started from an early age when V witnessed firsthand the vast gap between what society needs from our healthcare system and what our healthcare system is able to deliver based on traditional models. This observation sparked a determination to drive meaningful change in the field.

He understood that healthcare’s future depended on delivering a superior patient experience, value, and outcomes through thoughtfully designed technology. V identified AI’s transformative potential to fundamentally reshape care delivery, shifting from traditional human-centered models to AI-augmented systems.

During his PhD in Electrical Engineering, V established the theoretical groundwork for this vision—a future where AI Healers amplify human clinicians’ capabilities, making quality healthcare universally accessible.

After completing his doctorate, he founded Sword Health to realize his vision for a world where Sword's AI Healers are ever-present in our lives, ensuring we recover fully and quickly from conditions that affect our ability to live life to the fullest and making high-quality care as accessible as running water for everyone in the world.

Since 2020, Phoenix, Sword's AI Healer, has already treated more than 500,000 patients across three continents and delivered 6.5 million AI sessions across physical pain, women's health, and mental health, helping Sword's clients avoid nearly $1 billion in unnecessary healthcare costs.

This extraordinary impact is built upon a foundation of rigorous scientific research and innovation. V holds 40 patents and has authored over 40 peer-reviewed publications. His research spans sensor fusion algorithms, artificial intelligence, and neuroplasticity knowledge spaces, with work featured in leading scientific journals worldwide

I founded Massive Bio after a family situation in cancer because I am obsessed with enabling access to clinical trials to cancer patients around the globe regardless of their location and/or financial stability. I am also obsessed with ""making things work"" regardless of how difficult it is or even if I am the only person in the universe that believes in it. Lastly, I am obsessed with delighting our pharmaceutical and CRO customers as I understand the value of gaining and retaining customers. 

Prior to Massive Bio, I was at the founding team of EY's Private Equity Value Creation where I helped private equity companies in investment decisions in healthcare and how to maximize their return from their portfolio companies in their investment life-cycle. I have been a part of hundreds of deals. I spent 10 years in management consulting firms. 

In my career, I have always combined strategy, operations and transactions but laser-focused on a specific industry. Revenue generation, profitability and capital efficiency are my objective functions in building businesses. I enable hyper growth but a smart one, not a dumb one where 95% of the digital health companies target.   

Though I am hugely in love to Massive Bio and be with it until I die, I don't see myself slowing down and I will continue to found new companies. I just don't want to build a company and I want to build an industry.  

Outside healthcare, I am interested in energy and transportation industries. I am deeply inquisitive about the intersection of mathematics and technology.  

Prior to business, I finished half a dozen engineering degrees (2 BS+2 MS+PhD), mostly from University of Michigan, and I have even done a quick stint at majoring Math.

Sendur started his career in technology as a software developer working in C/C++/Java environments across client-server and web service architectures.  He worked in large cap technology firms as well as startups. 

Sendur worked for Morgan Stanley as an investment banker covering the software sector.

He has led the execution of several technology IPOs, including Fortinet, Tesla, Avago, Responsys, InvenSense, AVG and Splunk. He has worked on several software and technology M&A transactions, representing over $15 billion in aggregate value.

Sendur spent nearly 9 years transforming Splunk from a licensed software business to a Cloud company. Over the initial four years, he built from the ground-up the Corporate Development, Pricing and Competitive Intelligence teams.  Over the subsequent 4 years, Sendur has been the tip of the spear on shifting Splunk to a cloud business. As CPO, Sendur was responsible for converting the Splunk portfolio to a set of cloud-native services.  Sendur was responsible for all product management and delivery of Splunk's products and services.  This included managing the gross margin from the business.

Ofir and his 3 co-founders started Taranis in 2015 with a mission to help farmers protect their crops more efficiently.

I am very interested in technology, business and generally curious to learn new fields.

Taranis, a precision agriculture intelligence platform, helps Ag supply chain companies, input manufacturers and operating farms increase their yields and cut costs by giving them a way to effectively monitor their fields, make informed decisions and then act on them. The system uses sophisticated computer vision, data science and deep learning algorithms to detect early symptoms of weeds, uneven emergence, nutrient deficiencies, disease/insect infestations, water damage, equipment problems and more so that farmers can address issues quickly and understand the impact on yield and cost of production.
Taranis is the most comprehensive imagery solution for Ag in the world that combines all satellite constellation sources with analysis beyond NDVI, along with the broadest network on manned aircraft taking multispectral field mosaic at 8cm per pixel and the unique sub-mm imagery analyzed by deep learning called AI2 – the first leaf level imagery.",39,,Taranis,11 yrs 3 mos,Prime Minister's Office - Elite Technological Unit,7 yrs 11 mos,,,Bar-Ilan University,"Bachelor's Degree, Applied Mathematics, computer science",PMO,Project Management,C++,Python,Software Development,Start-ups,Entrepreneurship,5,,Guest on AcreForward Podcast discussing Taranis' innovation journey,,7.0,positive,,,,Leading AI-powered crop intelligence company Taranis,L4,"Ofir Schlam demonstrates strong technical leadership and operational experience combined with domain expertise.

It has always been the goal of our publishing, training, marketing and consulting company to operate at the forefront of the thinking skills “upgrade” revolution, using ""thinkologist"" approaches like these: 

• BrainMapping®, the tools and technology for helping people and their teams understand how they process information. This includes a premier instrumentality, The BrainMap®, and four other cutting-edge assessment tools.

• 59 Minute TeamBuilding™, a fast-moving, quick-results-producing ""power hour (less a minute)"" per week concept designed to take a group of like-minded colleagues and associates through 16 weeks of high-energy mutual exploration of a team's potential.

• Dolphin Strategy, the “do the next right, smart good thing” competency-, choice- and change-skills-building methods. This includes the unique DolphinThink® Workbook (co-created with Dr. Paul Kordis) for discovering the organizing principles and the natural advantages visible in the sum total of who you really are.

• Asset Report®: The Book of You, a fully customized and personalized 100-page-plus report on a user's thinking skills produced from the scores from a short but remarkably accurate (so we have often been told by clients) 1-page questionnaire.

• Several books on Dr. Graves' theory. This includes my latest feature-length work, LEAP! How to Think Like a Dolphin & Do the Next Right, Smart Thing Come Hell or High Water, available in both print and ebook editions from Brain Technologies and most major online book services.

She's the company's most invaluable asset, blowing all performance metrics out of the water. How did they spot her potential? Enter our Talent Intelligence Platform.

While most were playing catch-up with talent trends, we were in our lab, perfecting the world's most futuristic Talent Oracle. It's not just AI; it's like having Sherlock Holmes, Oprah, and Einstein combined, analyzing your talent pool. We address those head-scratchers:

""Which quirks make Jane in sales outsell the rest by 300%?""
""Are we missing the mark on what makes a stellar team member?""
""Can we predict if Raj will be a top performer or a coffee-break champion?""
""Is our ramp-up for rookies more of a crawl? How can we speed it up?""
""What if there's a retention landmine we're blindly stepping on?""
""Is Carlita in finance secretly the marketing maven we've been searching for?""
""What's the vibe check on our team's capability to shoot for the stars?""
""If our goal is to disrupt, are we even drafting the right dream team?""
""Could Jerome from logistics be the happiness czar our HR needs?""
""How can we gauge an employee’s sales mojo before they even make a call?""
""Who’s silently screaming 'enterprise role' while we pigeonhole them in commercials?""
""Is Alex right for upselling, or is he the renewal wizard we've been waiting for?""

By trusting our platform's magic:

We've sped up hiring from 0 to 60 in seconds flat.
Seen companies slash their ""goodbye"" rates from a cringe-worthy 44% to a mere 12%.
Rookie ramp-ups? Think of it as upgrading from a tricycle to a jet.
Cultured a workspace where gloom's out and 'heck yeah!' is in.
Watched as sales figures danced (and maybe moonwalked) to new heights.

And churn? Well, it's taken a backseat, while loyalty now rides shotgun.

ThisWay's team is comprised of experienced entrepreneurs, global PhD’s in the areas of machine learning and AI, as well as talent from across the globe. 

Over the last twenty years, I have founded and built three companies, in sectors that range from architecture to the licensing industry. The common core in each has been my ability to build consensus amongst stakeholders, whether they be individuals, businesses or international governments.

I am a recognized thought leader on the topics of ""Diversity and ROI"" and ""AI in the new world of work.""

Without knowing my history, it would seem that the leap from land development to tech development is a big one. However, ThisWay is the manifestation of my drive to solve big problems. As early as 1992, when I founded the Texas A&M College of Architecture Career Fair, through my award-winning land development plan in the early 2000s, I have always sought to find meaningful solutions to big challenges.

I started with the private side, where I found a robust industry of small charter bus  companies, run by families, and that spoke to my upbringing. 

📱I wrote the first apps to allow riders to crowdsource routes and crowdfund bus trips. Then I architected a platform that networks together the fleets of bus companies. I have since built a team to develop the first managed marketplace to automate the business of buses. And it's all proven with millions of customers. Here's some of the accomplishments that I'm most proud of:

📈Led the company from complete shutdown during the pandemic shutdowns, now on track to nine figures in annual revenue

🚌Created the leading assetless bus service in the United States with millions of customers

🏈Partnered with the NFL to promote bus ride share to Super Bowl 57 without a sponsorship

💱Approved by SEC to go public by merging with a SPAC, but chose not to due to market conditions

💸Raised tens of millions of dollars in financing while maintaining an exceptional capital efficiency ratio 

⚽Launched a pilot expansion into Germany by partnering with Daimler, Elemental, and FC Bayern Basketball

🌍Internationalized our entire platform and partnered with one of the largest bus operators  to launch the bus ride share in Brazil

🔗Merged the leading US mass mobility companies into a single platform

👭Executed the largest mass mobilization in a generation with the Women's March on Washington, moving 50,000 people in a single day to gatherings around the country

My Core Focus: Driving Innovation & Impact at Scale
I thrive on building and leading world-class, global technology organizations that deliver highly resilient, secure (consistent 99.998% uptime, zero incidents over a decade), and scalable systems. My expertise lies in:

* Enterprise AI Transformation: Pioneering the development and deployment of dozens of advanced agentic AI solutions, fundamentally changing how enterprises engage with customers and driving considerable new revenue streams (representing a major portion of recent ARR growth).

* SaaS Platform Excellence: Architecting and scaling cloud-native microservices platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP) from the ground up, achieving exceptional customer retention (e.g., 106% NRR) and operational stability.

* Empowering Leadership & Culture: Cultivating high-trust, high-accountability environments where exceptional talent is empowered to deliver their best. This philosophy has directly resulted in industry-leading team stability (e.g., <1% annual voluntary attrition) and the rapid delivery of market-differentiating products. My approach was pivotal in Quiq's strategic shift to an agentic AI leader, fostering deep collaboration and a fail-forward, growth mindset.

Strategic & Forward-Looking Approach
I excel at the intersection of technology execution, AI product strategy, and market leadership. Whether it's leading M&A technical integrations that significantly boost revenue, serving as a trusted technical advisor to boards and investors, or evangelizing technology to secure major enterprise deals, my focus is on translating complex technical capabilities into tangible business value and strategic advantage.

Jirav,Active,Martin Zych,"Financial modeling & data analytics expert for high growth companies. Follow me for posts about FP&A, Finance & Accounting Humor and tech.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/martinzych,"Austin, Texas, United States","Before becoming the CEO at Jirav, I spent 10 years working in finance, accounting, and tech.

I’ve worked as a Controller, Finance Director, and CFO. I helped multiple businesses grow from early startups to established corporations. Both in-house and with outsourced teams. And helped raise over $250 million in funding for clients across the globe.

During my time working in diverse environments, I came to realize that financial planning and analysis were outdated and cluttered, causing finance teams to lose a good night’s sleep.

There was a clear lack of efficient solutions to simplify important processes like planning, budgeting, forecasting, and reporting. Existing tools were too expensive and complicated, mostly designed for big enterprises. It was clear to me that smaller and mid-sized businesses needed an easy, intuitive, and data-driven platform for financial planning and analysis (FP&A).

Recognizing this gap, I took on the challenge and created Jirav.

Jirav is designed to help the very people who run small and mid-sized businesses, including founders, owners, accounting firms, and part-time CFO teams.

I'm proud to say that Jirav has already helped thousands of businesses better understand their financial situation, allowing them to make informed decisions. Jirav helps businesses see their financial and operational data clearly. It uses technology to simplify budgeting and forecasting and offers insights they can act on faster.

Now finance pros don’t have to worry about losing a good night’s sleep. Jirav frees them up to focus on growth and driving meaningful business outcomes.

Anyways…

When I'm not at Jirav, I'm a dad to two kids and a fan of Seattle sports teams. I also love outdoor activities like hiking and snowboarding, and you might even catch me discussing financial strategies on a mountain trail!

I believe in building strong connections, sharing knowledge, and helping others in their professional journey. As Jirav continues to grow, I'm committed to sharing our experiences with other entrepreneurs and finance professionals.

I'm the CEO and Founder of DoorSpace® - a SaaS company that is transforming the way healthcare organizations retain and develop clinical talent. I've spent the majority of my career working inside early-growth stage B2B tech startups and I love helping businesses solve their biggest data problems!

Which is why I developed DoorSpace® to enable healthcare organizations to solve their clinical turnover problem. Our innovative technology “flips the script” on the question of “what makes people leave?”, and instead asks “what makes people stay?”. 

We’ve built a platform specifically designed to make it easier for organizations to create a workplace where people want to stay. 

With our solution, healthcare organizations are better able to: 
* Know your people, and build strong relationships with them 
* Reduce friction/frustration in clinician’s workflow by eliminating wasteful administrative tasks
* Support your people more effectively in their career development

*** All while dramatically reducing the amount of time your clinicians and your administrative team is spending on manual data entry and paper pushing.***

At Microsoft, I led key initiatives in SharePoint Cloud, Visual Studio Dev, and Windows App Store strategy, products that reached over 190M million people. Later, as co-founder and CEO of a healthcare AI startup, I raised from top VCs (YC, Draper and others), secured performance based contracts worth $100M+ in enterprise deals, and drove to 8 figure revenues (with profitability) through large-scale Nationwide deployments with clients such as Anthem, Optum, Kaiser Permanente, UCSF, Dignity Health, Sharecare, and others. 

I serve on the Boards of Federation AI and advise Fortune 500 C Suite and high growth companies.

She began offering affordable in-home blowout services to her mommy friends, which quickly expanded into a mobile operation by 2009. In 2010, Webb opened the first Drybar in Brentwood, CA. 10 years later and over 150+ locations across the U.S., Webb’s Drybar has exploded into a nationally recognized and highly sought-after brand. 

Webb diversified the Drybar brand, creating a line of products and tools sold at popular retailers such as Nordstrom, Sephora, and Ulta, recently selling this product division to Helen of Troy for $255 million. Webb has been on the cover of Inc Magazine’s “How I Did This” issue, named the “100 Most Creative People in Business” by Fast Company, featured on Fortune magazine’s “40 Under 40” list, Marie Claire’s “Most Fascinating Women” and recently Inc. magazine recognized her as one of “The 100 Women Building America’s Most Innovative and Ambitious Businesses.” Webb appeared on season 10 of ABC’s Emmy nominated hit show “Shark Tank” as a guest shark in 2019.

David has worked as an executive producer, writer and development executive across film and TV. In 2015, his time in Israel's high-tech sector inspired the idea to blend AI with creative storytelling, leading to Vault's founding with some of Israel’s top AI engineers. 

With no funding or customer base, David journeyed to Los Angeles to bring Vault to market. His vision for using AI as a decision making companion quickly won the trust of top studios and network executives, who became Vault’s first clients.

Today, Vault is a leader in predictive analytics for entertainment, working across thousands of films and series. The company’s groundbreaking technology has revolutionized production, greenlighting, and marketing processes.

Under David’s leadership, Vault has achieved significant milestones:

- Raised over $10M in venture funding from corporate VCs in media and traditional venture capital firms
- Grew revenue from zero to millions annually
- Onboarded premier clients from top studios, networks, and streaming services
- Oversaw a tech stack that housed over 300+ AI models, working closely with clients to translate them into AI products used on 1000+ film and television titles

Alex is deeply passionate about the intersection of design and technology. His interests span IoT, UX design, machine learning, AI, smart home, and pushing the boundary on what's possible. 

Alex had his first success in middle school when he and his brother launched a consumer BMX website that quickly grew in popularity. His interests evolved towards physics, science, and engineering, and with a focus on impact he left high school early to work as a research scientist for the government. 

After working on nanotechnology and bioengineering projects for the Naval Research Lab, Harvard, Sandia National Lab, NASA, and UCLA, Alex consulted for the X Prize Foundation and Aerogel Technologies. With a desire to bridge his engineering interests and consumer products, Alex joined Fisker Automotive full time. It was at Fisker that Alex saw firsthand the power of combining brilliant engineering and elegant design to inspire consumers.

In 2011 Alex founded Hyphos Inc, a software company based in LA. With a passion to take what he learned in consumer product design and technology, Alex built a team aimed at bridging the online-offline gap in order to connect people in a more meaningful way. His first product, At The Pool, was featured in the likes of Forbes, LA Times, and Fast Company, and boasted members in more than 120 countries across 3,500 cities. Yeti, a local recommendation product that emerged from At The Pool passed 3,000,000 swipes in just the first few months.

In 2015, Alex launched Josh.ai with co-founder Tim Gill, aiming to revolutionize society's interaction with our environments. Initially focused on luxury smart homes, Josh.ai boasts the industry-leading natural language processing engine and home control platform, alongside its award-winning hardware.

Equal parts brand-builder and operator, she has over a decade of experience creating, growing, investing in, and acquiring brands.

In her time working on businesses, from ideation to multi-million dollar exits, she has crafted the ultimate DTC guides that she wishes existed when she started – she jokes, “This is the stuff they don’t tell you in business school. It’s for founders who need solutions – not an MBA”. Navigating the intersection of innovation and practicality, her playbook ‘The DTC Operator’ is a ‘how-to’ for turning entrepreneurial vision into reality. 

Suze is the co-founder and Chief Business Officer at Pattern Brands, a family of 7 purposeful brands that help people transform daily tasks into opportunities for enjoyment. In this role, she focuses on acquiring, integrating, and scaling sustainable, DTC-first businesses. Since inception, Pattern has raised over $50M, launched multiple marquee products to critical acclaim—including Wirecutter’s #1 towel and #1 spatula, and taken home Apartment Therapy’s 2023 Organization Award—and scaled in national retailers.

Before co-founding Pattern Brands, Suze led operations as General Manager & Partner at Gin Lane, the globally recognized independent agency that launched over 50 digitally native brands, including household names like Harry’s, Hims, and Sweetgreen. In this role, she balanced growth, profitability, and quality while overseeing P&L, helping the agency contribute to a staggering $15 billion in startup value.

Suze is also a respected thought leader in the DTC space, with features in The New York Times’ Wirecutter, DigiDay, and Modern Retail; speaking engagements at Harvard Business School, ShopTalk, Brand Innovators, and Foundermade; and multiple podcast appearances.

Alvaro began his career as a management consultant with Monitor Group working with the largest media and telecom companies around the world for almost 10 years. This experience was the foundation of his interest in mobile advertising. 

He is one of the pioneers in mobile advertising in the United States. After joining Greystripe in September 2006, he built a diverse and successful career in the industry since its inception. He has held different roles and been a critical contributor to the growth of two successful start-ups. He formerly served as COO of the largest independent advertising platform, Opera Mediaworks. He had a broad range of responsibilities and was ultimately responsible for the P&L of a rapidly growing company with offices in more than ten countries, over 350 employees, and 500 million mobile users.

Alvaro was the first non-founding member of Greystripe’s executive team where he built the largest ad-supported distribution network for games and applications before the App Store. When Greystripe shifted its business model, abandoning the feature phone market, he created the first mobile indirect sales strategy which ultimately led to the acquisition of Greystripe by Valueclick.

After the sale of Greystripe, Alvaro joined Mobile Theory when there were only six employees.  His contribution was pivotal in the sale of the company to Opera Software.  Under his operational and strategic leadership, Mobile Theory grew to 70 employees, its revenue multiplied by tenfold, and the company became one of the most profitable mobile ad networks.

I’ve seen the finest hardware, the most advanced software, and the relentless evolution of technology. Yet, something was missing through it all: a commitment to building technology that serves people rather than exploits them.

My search for something deeper led me to years of study under Kobun Chino Otogawa Roshi, the same Buddhist teacher who mentored Steve Jobs. Jobs gave the world the most iconic hardware ever created. But the software that followed? It still fails to deliver on its highest purpose. Phones have connected us, but they have not brought us closer together.

That’s why I/WE built Bonder. Not as another social platform. Not as a data-harvesting machine. Not as a tool to keep people endlessly scrolling.

But as something entirely new, a human-first platform designed to elevate how we connect, communicate, and engage with the world around us.

We recruited, hired, and trained over 500 recent college grads and trained 100s of companies and 1000s of sales reps over 15 years. We won numerous awards including several Inc 500 and Stevie’s. 

I built ExecVision to address the problems we experienced at Vorsight and Funnel Clarity, no accountability, and no reinforcement post sales training which leads to reps not getting better. I created the SaaS category, Conversation Intelligence which has companies valued over $10b. We grew the company to $10m ARR with 60+ employees, then drove the business to cash flow break even during the Pandemic and a successful exit to Mediafly.

As a tenured CEO of over 10 years in the software industry leading successful Series A SaaS companies, I have a proven track record of developing and executing strategies for growth, driving revenue and customer acquisition, and building high performance teams. I am skilled in crafting a compelling vision, leading organizations through change, and managing the full P&L. I have deep experience with cross functional strategy across Finance, Sales, Marketing, Customer Experience, and Product which drives success from closed deals to implementation, expansion, and renewals. 

As a seasoned startup SaaS advisor, I bring extensive experience and a track record of success in helping early-stage SaaS companies navigate the challenges of launching, scaling, and growing their businesses.

ioCurrents,Active,Erik Logan,"Operations, Engineering, and Product Executive",https://www.linkedin.com/in/erikllogan,"Redmond, Washington, United States","Building technology companies and products has been my passion for over 25 years. My focus is on creating long term business value by planning and implementing the right products, processes, and solutions that match the needs of a specific business environment. I love diving into customer problems and solving them using creative solutions while building the right teams and infrastructure to get the job done.

Throughout my career there have been a few quotes that have stuck out with respect to my own working experiences. While most are obvious, it is the implementation of them that can be challenging. I continue to use these and others as guiding principles to push for success and to learn from failure. 

“The essence of strategy is choosing what not to do” - Michael Porter

In any business, there are finite resources. Getting all product or operational ideas out on the table and intentionally choosing what NOT to do is more important than choosing what to do. In my experiences in greenfield environments this can be easier, however over time momentum and inertia can cause priority inversion. To keep the business aligned with strategy, we had to be very intentional about how to treat new versus current ideas and continuously iterate on the question of what provides the most value. 

“There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one works.” - Alan Perlis

No program, process, or product will be 100% error-free. There is always a trade off of time versus perfection, technical debt versus time to market. The push and pull in every environment is different, however some details are above others with respect to your customers or internal stakeholders experience. In my career, when we ‘sweat’ those details, we were successful, even if the other areas were not 100%. 

 “Sometimes you have to take a break from being the kind of boss always trying to teach people things. Sometimes you just have to be the boss of dancing.” - Michael Scott

People need an environment where they can be successful. When a team isn’t working, it is usually a process problem or a management problem. My teams have been most successful when I have met people where they are, been human, and figured out how to help them be successful. That said, sometimes you have to leave people behind. 

“Sometimes you are the piranha, and sometimes you are the meat” - Lance Young

My career started as a successful computer programmer, but after getting married and buying a house, I decided to take the H&R Block Tax course. It changed the direction of my career.

I love numbers and logic. Enjoyment is derived when taking complex data and distilling it into understandable pieces that can be used to make decisions. It’s fun showing people that although common financial statements are useful, they are universally NOT the only metrics that determine the health of a business. I’m passionate about teaching people and making a case for why other KPI’s need watching. Building processes, charts, and MD&A enriched financials is fun. I nerd-out building SQL queries to extract data and then serve as the Excel guru who can manipulate these extractions. Peace, for me, is found in organizing, improving accuracy, and building efficiencies. Not much brings more joy to me than collaboration and intelligent discourse. Creativity and entrepreneurism have played a big role in my life.

Personally: I’m a family man, married for over 20 years with two teenage daughters, a goldfish, a dog, and two cats. I enjoy lots of hobbies including art, music, photography, fly fishing, snowboarding, cross country skiing, snowshoeing, hiking, running, playing basketball, playing softball, playing board games, reading books, writing, and watching cinema.

After a decade in industry, I am currently pursuing my PhD in human-robot interaction at Yale University in order to dive deeper into the user experiences and technologies of the future. 

I believe that smartphone screens are the UI of the past, and that the key to the future lies in more immersive, tangible, and human technologies. I’ve spent the latest phase of my career building these types of experiences, whether a social robot for health habits, a conversational AI for sleep, or an electric vehicle charger that comes to life. I seek to build a future where our devices help us become who we want to be, rather than sucking our energy and attention away from what it means to be human.

Prior to pursuing my PhD, I was the VP of Product at Volta Charging, responsible for millions in revenue from EV charging and media products based in connected hardware and machine learning. I was also the founder and CEO of MOTI, a minimal social robot to help user build daily health habits. A few highlights from these roles and others include:

• Led the end-to-end development of two new electric vehicle charging stations with internationally award-winning industrial design and smart sensors.
• Grew the product department at Volta by 5x in one year, including establishing the hardware, QA, and product management teams.
• Invented, designed, and founded the social robotics and behavior change startup, MOTI. Featured in Fast Company, TechCrunch, Engadget, and more.
• Selected as one of 16 designers from around the world by the Google Creative Lab for their inaugural design founders program, 30 Weeks.
• Taught design thinking at Northwestern and human-centered design with Design for America.
• Graduated with a dual degree in Mechanical Engineering and Art from Yale University and helped form the Yale Center for Engineering, Innovation, and Design.

I very much enjoy speaking on the topics of foundership, human-centered design, social robotics, and habit formation. In the past, I have been a guest lecturer at the Hult Business School, California College of Arts, and Stanford d.School.

Previously, I pioneered innovative anti-piracy solutions that helped the world’s top media companies—like Disney, Warner Bros., and Netflix—maximize revenues for their premium digital content. Following my tenure at Microsoft—where I am a named inventor on 12+ patents—I developed a solution that delivered actionable insights for Cisco, Microsoft, and Disney to combat multibillion-dollar losses from illegal distribution. I then led Marketly to scale the industry’s best-in-class search enforcement platform, earning trust with 100+ global rights holders. To accelerate impact, I guided Marketly’s acquisition by Corsearch, expanding its reach as a leader in online brand protection.

BUILDING STRONG, SCALABLE FOUNDATIONS

I've driven growth that benefits companies, teams, and customers alike—whether within a global enterprise or a lean startup. At Marketly, I fostered a results-driven culture with nearly 100% customer and employee retention while scaling operations across Silicon Valley, Seattle, and India. At Microsoft, I contributed to internal startup teams, co-creating Microsoft’s online ad-delivery infrastructure, architecting LiveMeeting’s audio/video conferencing solution, and leading a cross-functional initiative to launch the Windows Phone app store.

A LIFELONG LEARNER & BUILDER

Inspired by my 7th-grade programming teacher, I’ve long been passionate about using technology to solve real-world problems. I pursued a computer science degree at USC to fuel my entrepreneurial ambitions, later earning my MBA from the University of Washington while working at Microsoft. Alongside leading teams and building companies, I continue to explore innovation lab projects and regularly take advanced courses at Stanford to sharpen my skills.

Boldness has genius, power and magic in it. Begin it now."" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe

Studied, worked and lived in 8 countries while taking any job from call-center to translation to public service to support my single mother, ultimately leading to a Masters Degree at UC Berkeley which directed me into product/program management and operations in technology, and building startups from the ground up. This shaped my strong belief that nothing is impossible in life.

Admittedly I did not have the most linear career, but these unique experiences have defined my mindset and adaptability to the most challenging environments and adversity while delivering high-quality results under enormous pressure by never giving up.

I am a creative self-starter who takes pride in achieving ambitious results through teamwork in order to make a difference in this world.

Growing up, I always wondered what made games, apps, and computers tick. Some of my fondest memories are taking apart computers and putting them back together in my grandparent's basement. However, it wasn't until I installed Game Maker Studio that I realized that I loved to code and create projects using code. All throughout high school, I spent my free time learning how to code and make video games. My senior year, I took an AP Computer Science (Java) class. One of the highlights of the course was that we were tasked to come up with an Android app that would solve a problem in the community. I came up with an app that would help connect food pantries with grocery stores and other businesses. This was where I discovered SQL, XML and concepts like user authentication.

Currently, I am a junior at Illinois State University, majoring in Computer Science. I am also a Lab Assistant for Illinois State University's IT 168 class. I enjoy helping others learn code and sharing a passion with other intuitive people. My most recent personal project has been the development of a website that helps connects local businesses with local charities and food banks. Because of the pandemic, I've been inspired to take action and use my skills to help out my community. One of my biggest motives was the knowledge that more families were going to go hungry due to unemployment and the fact that schools were not meeting up in person. When I was in school I saw first hand the importance of school and the resources that it provided to needy kids. I was so lucky to find a group of friends who were just as passionate and willing to work with me on this project. For the development, we have been mainly been using GitHub, HTML5, CSS, Node.js, SQL, and JavaScript. 

My specialties include learning new skills quickly, Java, SQL, C, XML, Git, and JavaScript. I have started to learn HTML, Node.js, and CSS. I have also started studying and creating neural networks and perceptrons.

For the last 10 years, I've been working at startups in the areas of AI, machine learning, big data, and infrastructure.  Since dropping out of the CS Ph.D program at Berkeley, I've been on a journey of designing systems of increasing scope: starting from deep technical problems early in my career, to now building teams and defining product & business strategy.

I love to make things that other people think are impossible.  In grad school, I published research on automated synthesis of high-perf parallel algorithms (15 years before LLMs).  At Mozilla, I created a mobile operating system that was built around the core of the ""old, bloated, slow"" Firefox desktop browser, that we got running on the lowest-end $30 smartphones.  My first startup exited to Apple after pushing the boundaries of deep learning on embedded devices.  I built an AI dog-training robot in months, and an AI-enabled GPU-accelerated Chrome browser running in the cloud.

• Enterprise SaaS (VC-backed ~$50M, B-Round)
• E-Commerce Agency (bootstrapped)
• Consumer Tech (bootstrapped)

During this journey, I've been fortunate enough to work with some of the most passionate, caring, and driven people in the world. Building businesses and uniting a diverse set of people to accomplish a shared vision and mission is what I love.

My most recent venture was Alyce - www.alyce.com, acquired in February 2024. This enterprise SaaS platform made gifting not just a marketing and sales tool, but also a mindset and approach to creating authentic business relationships. Tens of thousands of marketers and sellers used Alyce to strengthen their most important connections, all while making a positive impact on the world.

Before Alyce, I founded One Pica (now Astound Digital), a global e-commerce agency. I was a part of this company until its acquisition in December 2012. During my time there, I helped build some of the largest commerce and supply chain infrastructures in the world for companies like 3M and Scholastic.

I've also helped grow and facilitate the acquisitions of several retailers, taking them from six-figure revenue to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in just a few years. It's all about execution.

In addition to building businesses, I am passionate about mentoring and advising women and underrepresented founders, especially having a daughter who I want to see have every opportunity I have had.

Freatz,Active,Lucas Judice,CEO @Freatz | Data & AI Executive | Lawyer | Business Advisor | Author,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lucasjudice,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Throughout my life, I've been driven by a relentless pursuit of challenges and personal growth. From my early days selling lemonade at my parent's beach house in Brazil at 5 years old to my initial foray into the legal world, and now my transition into the tech entrepreneurial space, my journey has been marked by determination, adaptability, and a keen sense for business opportunities.

At 14, I began my professional journey as a mail clerk in a law firm, showcasing my early organizational and communication skills. I eventually transitioned into an intern role, honing my analytical and problem-solving abilities. By 22, after completing Law School, I was deeply immersed in the legal world, demonstrating a strong aptitude for legal research, negotiation, and client relations. My contributions to the field were further solidified with the publication of three books, including two titled ""Startup Law"" in Brazil, and several articles in specialized journals. Notably, my thesis garnered recognition and was cited by Supreme Court Justices, also in Brazil.

2008 was a pivotal year. I founded the Pimenta Judice Law Office and celebrated the birth of my twins (later in 2011 followed by the birth of my third child). 

The publication of my books, especially ""Startup Law,"" marked the beginning of my transition from a legal expert to a tech entrepreneur, bridging the gap between law and the startup ecosystem.

In 2012, inspired by my writings and the evolving tech landscape, I established MidStage Ventures, a venture builder that evolved from my law practice. This endeavor not only renewed the excitement I felt as a young entrepreneur but also showcased my ability to innovate and scale businesses.

Relocating to Los Angeles in 2013 was another transformative moment. In LA, I expanded MidStage Ventures internationally and pursued a Master's degree from the University of Southern California. This academic pursuit at USC was a pivotal moment, further steering my career towards tech entrepreneurship and broadening my horizons.

Today, with experience on the Board of Directors for 20 companies and a rich history in international ventures and conferences, I lead as the CEO of Freatz / AlmoçoGrátis in both Brazil and the United States. My journey from the legal realm to the tech world underscores my adaptability, cross-cultural management skills, and global business strategy expertise.",31,,Chief Executive Officer,Freatz · Full-time,CEO,Almoço Grátis,Board Member - LA Chapter,California Restaurant Association · Seasonal,University of Southern California,"Master of Laws (LL.M.), Business Law",Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo,"Master of Laws (LL.M.) - Civil Procedure, Civil Procedure",Data-driven Decision Making,Data Analytics,Business Strategy,Business Planning,Corporate Law,2,,Mission Matters podcast interview; Restaurant Technology Guys podcast interview,0,5.0,positive,,,,Published two books about startup law; Transitioned from lawyer to tech entrepreneur; CEO of Freatz / AlmoçoGrátis in Brazil and the United States,L4,"Lucas Judice demonstrates a strong track record as both a legal professional and entrepreneur, with evidence of successful business building and operational experience.

For many years, this philosophy has guided not only my personal but also my professional life: how can I use my skills and expertise to live a purpose-filled, results-driven life each day in ways that are meaningful to me and beneficial to society at large? 

It was these aspirations that led me to leave investment banking and apply my commercial abilities towards climate solutions and social impact. This principle of living purposefully and in the moment also informs my belief in the importance of adaptability, resourcefulness, and action by quickly triaging and implementing optimal solutions.

With these ideas as my north star, I’ve had the privilege of accomplishing a great many things, of which I’m very proud. Some major accomplishments include:

✓ I raised $1.1B in private equity capital for nature-based and infrastructure decarbonization projects, including $500M from a single PE investor that led to purchase of one of the world’s largest forestry companies.
✓ I raised $10M in seed capital for tech-led communications, energy conservation, and social impact ventures.
✓ I developed strategic partnerships with world leading financial institutions, including First Reserve, Goldman Sachs, Oak Hill, Och-Ziff, TPG, and UBS.  
✓ I led two of Blackstone’s largest M&A transactions: the $12B merger of Albertsons and American Stores, and the $17B sale of Albertsons to SuperValu, CVS, and Cerberus consortium.
✓ I have broad industry and functional leadership experience as Founder, CEO, COO, CDO, Board Member, and M&A advisor.

These accomplishments were made possible through a focused assessment of the resources at hand and a desire to use those resources to create positive change.

My engineering approach combines deep technical expertise in autonomous systems with practical deployment experience across cloud, edge, and robotic platforms.

As the first full-time hire at Mycro Harvest, I architected a complete IoT ecosystem for agricultural monitoring—integrating edge sensors, networked communications, and cloud analytics into a cohesive system. I implemented both the infrastructure layer (Kubernetes, CI/CD, secure remote device management) and the application layer (REST APIs, React frontends, data visualization), while collaborating on the hardware design and firmware that powers our edge devices.

My academic research explored statistical optimization of neural network architectures for autonomous control systems, where I developed methods to balance inference latency with model performance—a critical consideration for robotics applications. I created a complete simulation environment that follows the OpenAI Gymnasium standard, enabling rapid testing of control algorithms under realistic conditions.

My robotics experience includes implementing SLAM, path planning algorithms, and motor control logic, as well as creating containerized architectures with ROS for autonomous navigation. I've designed systems that effectively process sensor fusion data (vision + depth) for 3D object detection and classification, essential for robot-environment interaction.

I'm particularly passionate about networked robotics challenges—how to create resilient, distributed systems that can intelligently coordinate action across multiple agents and varying network conditions. My work spans the full technology stack, from low-level embedded programming (FreeRTOS, ESP-IDF) to cloud orchestration (Kubernetes), unified by a consistent focus on building reliable, adaptable autonomous systems.

Now as R2.ai becomes part of the Pharmaron family, Yiwen is excited to return to the intersection of AI and science, driving transformative AI advancements within the pharmaceutical industry.

Originally a chemist, Yiwen began working with Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in 1995 when his PhD research required him to write his own backpropagation neural network and other machine learning algorithms. 

Excited by the possibilities the world of data management and machine learning had to offer, Yiwen entered the world of enterprise software development full time in 1998. 

As the Product Director at Teradata, Yiwen directed the development of the first distributed ML platform, revolutionizing the world of ML with a platform that cut the time to train a model with terabytes of data from several weeks - to mere minutes.

But even with those advancements, most businesses still struggled to adopt machine learning because they didn’t have enough expertise in-house.

In 2015, Yiwen started R2.ai with the goal of making AI accessible for businesses of all sizes by automating heavy lifting of the ML  development so both AI experts and non-experts could quickly develop and deploy solutions to real business problems.

Today, R2.ai  is a recognized pioneer in the market, with over 2,200 users.

Companies benefit most from R2.ai’s platform:

-- Have large volumes of data, and want to leverage those massive data sets into better customer experiences, revenue, or risk management (but may be concerned about the upfront cost)

-- Want to accelerate their current ML projects - knowing they provide a key advantage over their competitors

-- Are looking for a way to leverage AI and ML with their existing resources (whether they have in-house machine learning experts or not)

-- Believe in continuous improvement and are looking for a way to further improve their ML Models

Trusted by Notion, Intercom, and Descript.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/bobbypinero,"Boise, Idaho, United States","I left Intercom after taking them from $1M ARR to $150M+ as Head of Finance.

Immediately after that, I had the opportunity to join another startup as their first finance hire. It represented a clear path to earning more money while keeping a balanced lifestyle.

But I turned it down to start Equals and build the next generation spreadsheet.

Not only did taking “easy choice” feel like denying my full creative potential (I’m not just a finance guy, I love marketing, product, and branding too)...

…but it set a poor example for my two children, whom I prioritize over everything else.

Because it would teach them…

1. “Steady as she goes” always beats rocking the boat
2. Denying their ambitions and dreams is okay as long as they're paid off enough

But worst of all, it would teach them to always fear failure more than regret.

And I admit I feared failure more than I should’ve when Equals was just getting started.

For starters, most investors told us we’d never beat Google or Microsoft at the spreadsheet game.

And even after we’d found investors willing to bet on us, our initial go-to-market was rocky— 

Struggling to zero in on a viable ICP, cycling through marketing leads, and having to ditch the freemium SaaS “lean startup” playbook in the process.

But over the years, Equals has emerged as something wholly unique: the fastest, most flexible way to measure and report on your SaaS business by far.

Equals empowers SaaS to integrate data from Stripe, Salesforce, HubSpot, SQL, and more all in one single source of truth.

Because getting ARR from 0 to 97% is relatively simple.
But getting it from 97% to 100%? Incredibly hard.

And that’s exactly what Equals solves (thanks to Descript’s Head of Finance for that description).

We’ll even build your dashboard for you to prove it.

I’m a builder at heart — I love turning ideas into real, working products that people find useful and easy to use. 

Over the years, I’ve led teams, launched platforms, and grown products from the ground up by staying focused on what really matters: solving real problems, planning thoughtfully, and working closely with great people.

As a cofounder, I’ve worn a lot of hats — from product and planning to operations and team leadership. I know how to keep things moving, how to make decisions when there’s no clear answer, and how to balance vision with day-to-day execution.

I care deeply about clear communication, strong collaboration, and building momentum across teams. 

Whether I’m mapping out a roadmap or guiding a team through tough choices, I lead with purpose, keep things practical, and make sure we’re always moving forward.

What I bring to the table:

•	Clear product thinking

•	Strategic planning that actually gets done

•	Calm, steady leadership

•	Cross-team alignment

•	A get-it-done mindset

The following 15, already in Spain, mostly in the areas of real estate development and promotion, and the PV solar energy.

In June 2016, a group of Venezuelan investors hired me as the General Director of a technological startup, designed to create an innovative real estate portal, using ultimate generation programming languages (Angular JS, HTML5/JS/CSS3), and deploying deep learning and machine learning algorithms. 

The latter opened my mind to a previously less known field of knowledge and aroused in me an enormous curiosity to delve into the applications that such technological advances might have in other areas.

In December of that same year, under an agreed deal, I left the company that owns the portal, to enter the Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications related world. Among other things, I learned about the advent of the technological singularity, term coined by the futurist Ray Kurzweil, co-founder of Singularity University. On this, I focus on advances in science and technology for the prevention and treatment of diseases linked to aging (neurodegenerative, cardiovascular, cancer, etc), and ultimately, the curing of aging itself, eventually allowing for a considerable increase in the healthy life expectancy and lifespan of the human race. 

I follow closely and practice networking with scientists and other world leaders who are committed to these ideas and are working on them.

Transcend Robotics,Active,Phillip Walker,Senior Researcher at Smart Information Flow Technologies,https://www.linkedin.com/in/pmwalk,"Alexandria, Virginia, United States","How do you find structure in chaos? How do you control and predict the changes in that structure? What can we learn from nature when building complex, distributed systems that humans can use and understand? I enjoy working on projects that seek answers to these questions. I want to make complex systems more intuitive and predictable for the people in charge of managing them, and I enjoy pulling influences from diverse fields of knowledge to do so.

In the past few years I have:
* Improved the resilience of computer networks using strategies employed by honeybees to defend their hives.
* Developed virtual reality interfaces to visualize and control hundreds of robots simultaneously.
* Debated the impact future fleets of delivery drones will have on everyday citizens going about their lives below them.

As we grow and become more connected, understanding how to control the chaos becomes more crucial than ever. I want to bring order to the chaos, and have a blast while doing it.

Interested in checking out my work? Here are some recent projects I've had the pleasure of working on:
