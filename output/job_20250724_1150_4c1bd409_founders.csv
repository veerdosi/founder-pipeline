Bio (see curtisnorthcutt.com):
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT,  advised by quantum computer inventor (and friend) Isaac Chuang. Before that, I was awarded the NSF Fellowship and MIT Morris Joseph Levin Masters Thesis Award for my work at MIT. I also TA'd graduate machine learning (6.867) at MIT. Before that, I graduated as valedictorian from Vanderbilt University (2009-2013) where I majored in math and CS and was awarded the Barry M. Goldwater National Scholarship.

My work spans the theory and applications of AI including uncertainty quantification and augmenting human capabilities. I invented confident learning and founded Cleanlab, a company that makes AI work reliably by curating the knowledge bases that power the AI systems. Before that, I created the CAMEO cheating detection system used to validate certificates in MITx and HarvardX online course teams. I am grateful to learned a ton working at places like Google AI, Oculus Research, Facebook AI Research, Amazon AI, Microsoft Research, NASA, MIT, and Harvard.

Growing up below the poverty line in rural Kentucky, I felt the glass ceiling of limited human and monetary resources. The ladder of opportunity often rises from prosperity rather than ability. My ladder was my education. Education led to exposure, summer programs, scholarships, and eventually opportunity. Everyone deserves access to quality educational resources – this underlies my motivation to pursue research that democratizes education and augments human learning and capabilities. This is why I spent my early years at MIT inventing the CAMEO cheating detection algorithm used to validate MITx and HarvardX certificates for open-access, free online courses, called MOOCs.

For over a decade, I've experienced AI workload complexity explode—from simple ML models to GenAI distributed training, multi-modal, and agentic workflows. This complexity is now growing far faster than our ability to manually manage the underlying infrastructure.

I saw this firsthand during my computer vision and robotics research at MIT, and over several years building my Healthcare AI company, Engooden (acquired by SLQT). 

My co-founder, Niranjan, witnessed the same inevitable trend while building warehouse automation robotics at SixRiver (acquired by Shopify). 

We both knew a breaking point was coming where human-led DevOps could no longer keep up.

That's why we built Cedana. 

We're creating the autonomous infrastructure layer for the next era of AI, freeing human ingenuity to focus on discovery instead of fighting a losing battle with tools.

Result: AI Factory Ltd. With this came the need to develop a solid generic AI API and testbed architecture to allow easy 3rd party integration of game engines into their products. This took the name ""Fireball"" (for obscure historical reasons) and has now provided a successful and widely adopted cross-platform API for any game application. This necessary product was borne from my experience of observing the sometimes grievous difficulties experienced by other games companies attempting to take on 3rd party engines. 
After 11 years of incremental development, we are where we need to be, with our engines appearing in so many game applications, from PC, console, mobile and IFE. We have an estimated 200 million people using our game engines. The company has just 3 founder shareholder/employees, expanding any needed bandwidth by partnering other companies for specific projects.

After reading the Scaling Hypothesis in 2020, I got extremely scaling-pilled and shifted my entire focus to LLMs. I joined Aleph Alpha over two years ago, helping build a novel, distributed training framework from scratch with state-of-the-art efficiency.
Following endlessly discussions on the latest AI research, traveling together to ICML, NeurIPS and more, Vincent Weisser and I decided at end of 2023 to go all in on Prime Intellect to build our vision of an open and decentralized future of AI.

At Prime Intellect we are building the infrastructure for decentralized AI development at scale. We aggregate global compute and enable researchers to collaboratively train state-of-the-art models through distributed training across clusters.

As a VC at Formation 8, I invested early in companies like Ironclad that transformed legal operations. One pattern became clear: the most successful firms were using technology to amplify their lawyers' capabilities, not replace them.

This insight led me to found Paxton AI, where we're solving one of law's biggest challenges: making legal research faster and more accurate. Our platform recently achieved 94% accuracy on Stanford's Legal Hallucination Benchmark, setting a new standard for reliable AI in law.

My journey from MIT (PhD, Engineering) to legal tech wasn't obvious. But combining engineering precision with legal complexity is exactly what's needed to build trustworthy AI for lawyers.

Currently helping law firms:
• Cut research time by 70%
• Expand into new practice areas
• Maintain 100% citation accuracy
• Scale operations efficiently

Koala cuts through the noise, empowering growth and sales teams to engage warm prospects seamlessly – and automatically. We enable reaching out with timely, genuinely helpful nudges to prospects already showing real buying intent.

I had previously been a professional musician and really wanted to be creative again so I ventured into restaurant ownership. With an amazing team, my business partner and I have opened three restaurants, Olmsted, Maison Yaki and Patti Ann's -- all with a simple ethos: delicious food and sustainability. We are confident that these two things do not have to be mutually exclusive.

Helping to create unique experiences for people has always been a passion of mine, whether through music or hospitality.

My new venture KOALA is reinventing the way people travel and powering the future of shared ownership and vacation real estate.


I’ve been fortunate to work with very talented and inspiring people. I surround myself with partners and teams that share these values. My motto is simple: ""Find good people and do great things.”

I'd like my reputation to be: ""talk to that guy and you'll leave energized, thinking about something new, good things will happen, and it'll generally cost you nothing.”

Currently, I'm part of Origami's exceptional founding team.

We build Research Agents who find prospects that fit nuanced filters and would take SDRs hours to sniff out manually.

Well at least initially...

Scaled that to $50k/mo in 2-3 months. No frontend. Just CSVs of incredible data.

Then, customers started using our Agents to make their CRM a live database.
Refreshing records, surfacing buying signals, tracking champions, etc.

Interesting...

Most recently, we learned our Agents could repair dysfunctional CRM structures.
Parent/child mapping, outdated account info, etc.

Pretty sick!

Now, we build AI Research Agents that work from your CRM to autonomously handle tasks like:

- Finding upsell opportunities through M&A
- Fixing incorrect or duplicate records
- Tracking your champions when they move
- Enriching missing contact info
- Updating outdated info on your accounts 
- Finding new data points for your outbound 
- Gathering data from PDFs, complex search bars, locators, scroll feeds, and unique databases

We’ve deployed hundreds of Research Agents to work like humans for the fastest-growing sales teams.

Some stats:
- We were YC's fastest growing startup in 2024.
- We've helped companies close over $20M in revenue.
- Our avg customer does 3.4x their previous meeting book rates.

This realization led me to build Simular AI. We're creating AI agents that use computers like humans do - clicking, typing, and navigating interfaces - so you can focus on what truly matters.

My journey spans:

- Research: 39 papers in top AI venues (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICLR)
- Engineering: Scaled AI systems at Google (Ads, Maps, YouTube)
- Leadership: Built & led teams in autonomous driving
- Competition: 2x World Finalist in ACM/ICPC

Now, I'm on a mission to democratize AI assistance. Because the future of work isn't about replacing humans - it's about augmenting them.

Ask yourself these questions...

🔹 Does your current system make it easy to get answers to the questions you want to know? Or does everything seem to take longer than it should?

🔹 Do you wish there were less manual steps to set up, run, and understand the results from your models?

🔹 Are you concerned about the model governance and change management capabilities within your current modeling tool?

🔹 Are you maybe even still using outdated systems or an excel spreadsheet?

In order not to go broke, we had to get users to stay on the platform long enough. And for that we had to talk to them. 

Problem was: We couldn’t talk to 1,000s of users 1on1. 

So we built an AI to do it for us. 

One that listens to every customer and deeply understands what they care about.

It worked so well that we thought: 

What if every company could do this?

- Talk to hundreds of customers simultaneously
- Listen to & understand their preferences
- Turn them into actionable insights

This is exactly what Listen Labs does today.

Whether you're testing products or exploring new markets, Listen is a skilled researcher that works 24/7, delivering insights in hours instead of weeks.

Leading companies like Microsoft, Canva, Chubbies, and others use our insights to make more customer-driven decisions.
