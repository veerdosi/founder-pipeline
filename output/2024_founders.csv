2wai,Active,Alexander Finden,Creative Consultant at 2wai,https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexfinden,"Encinitas, California, United States","I am a creative technologist and startup leader with a track record of launching cutting-edge platforms in interactive media, AI storytelling, and community-driven entertainment. I bring deep experience at the intersection of technology and narrative design, driving innovation from concept to scale.

Inside and outside the workplace, I have been called a bonfire of creative energy. Currently, I'm channeling that energy into my role as Creative Lead at 2wai, a new company aiming to create the most accessible, reliable, and lifelike digital avatars. My wide diversity of creative and operational expertise has allowed me to play a highly valuable role in the early-stage company alongside its founders.

Prio to 2wai, I was Creative Director at Play Alchemy, an indie game studio specializing in automation and AI games. I oversaw all art creation, storytelling, and content strategy for both in-house titles and our clients' games, such as ""The Lunatics"" for AAA shooter Shrapnel.

Prior to my involvement with Play Alchemy, I co-founded a solution to inequities in the nature media industry called Mammalz. For over 5 years, I helped raise three rounds of funding, developed a live video streaming social platform similar to Twitch from scratch, managed a team of 3-5 direct reporters and over a dozen vendor relationships, and helped launch careers for dozens of creators by monetizing their thousands of fans.

Before Mammalz, I was a freelance content producer. My greatest achievement was Alliestrasza's YouTube channel, which I grew from 900 to over 100,000 subscribers. I also worked on countless live broadcasts, TV shows, indie films, and documentaries, one of which will premiere on Netflix in 2025.

Some other things I’ve created in the past:

• Magier Browser Extension: One-click, sub-millisecond redaction of PII and sensitive data in ChatGPT, Claude, Google Docs and more
• Magier Mobile: iOS and Android solution for redacting voice, image and text data on the go, ideal for frontline, hybrid and BYOD environments

💡 Why We’re Different

• AI-native, invisible security: no latency, no user disruption

With almost two decades of experience in the content and digital marketing space, I (along with my team members at Justwords) help businesses achieve their growth goals through content marketing-driven digital marketing. We are equal parts strategy, content marketing, SEO, and finally execution. 

I am always looking for ways to implement powerful marketing strategies that are rooted in knock-out-good content and SEO, awesome storytelling and not too salesy. Over the last decade, me and my team have been using a framework of content, SEO, powerful storytelling and marketing to help brands find real visibility with their target audience. I love to explain that we work with data, brand and heart. But as we set up the digital journeys, we help businesses become welcome intruders. 

This is what I specialise in:

* Content strategies that are built on buyer journeys and linked to business goals, and execution. 
* Content marketing that works because of efficient strategies, 10x growth content and really great SEO techniques
* Digital marketing with a holistic approach

I am proud that Justwords is ranked as one of the top content marketing agencies in India by CLUTCH.co, with plenty of good reviews. Its these testimonials that make me the most happy, validating that our processes are honest and rewarding. 

Here is something you can always trust me to do – 

- Give you an honest opinion about what your brand can achieve through digital marketing 
- Never overpromise on deliverables
- Not to sign up a client if I don’t believe we can deliver or if I do not find it challenging 
- Be honest about failures and get back on my feet to pack a punch back.
- Give it my best shot

Highlight,Active,Richard Thomas,Founder & CEO at Highlight - 25 years helping Enterprises and Service Providers work better together,https://uk.linkedin.com/in/richard-rmt,"Lower Eashing, England, United Kingdom","I'm the Founder and CEO of Highlight.

Over the last ten years we've watched the IT industry separate into two parts, like oil and water : companies that provide services; and companies that consume them. 

It should work. Enterprises want less involvement in their IT. They want to make shoes, sell cheeseburgers, run an airline. They're happy to let someone else handle the tech. And Providers are keen to step in. They want to deliver that technology, build a relationship, become the 'trusted advisor'.

Some Service Providers have figured out how to make this relationship work. The successful ones have realised you need a far greater level of conversation with your Enterprise customers, than the days when you just sold bandwidth or hosting. This conversation is now incredibly important, because both parties now depend on one another for the continued success of their business: for revenue, growth, stability, advice and feedback, and much more.

Highlight's mission is to facilitate that conversation. We provide a clear, uncluttered picture of how Providers are delivering IT services, and how Enterprises are using them: networks, infrastructure, applications and cloud services. Both sides - Service Provider and Enterprise - use the same tool, see the same information. Service Providers can win, understand, support, talk to and retain customers ; and those customers can manage their technology.

Personally, I sit on the engineering, technical side of life. I'm optimistic but pragmatic, I like taking on big problems, and building software people actually enjoy using. I like good coffee, sailing, and partnering with customers who share our love of delivering outstanding service. I think business success is largely about building the right team of people, and then stepping back and letting them get on with things. Management and leadership are skills you never stop learning - definitely not easy, but worth the effort.

I'm a tech founder improving legal US immigration for businesses.

I was originally born in China, and immigrated to Canada at the age of 3.

Whenever my family would take a trip to China, it would always be a long manual process that would take weeks to complete.

And that too - the visitor process is relatively low stakes, what are immigrants going through?

I moved to the US for a YC batch, and realized that the US immigration law firms - while better -  are still operating with bureaucratic processes from manual form filling, to automatable LCA/PAF compliance done by hand.

I teamed up with my lifelong friends to build a better immigration platform for businesses - one that utilizes software to automate the manual processes of immigration, integrates with HRIS to automatically complete applications, and automates compliance updates.

By bringing modern tooling to immigration, we're able save teams 10+ hours per week in manual work, eliminate human error, and offer competitive rates for visas when compared to traditional law firms.

SuperMe,Active,Casey Winters,Chief Evaluation Officer,https://www.linkedin.com/in/caseywinters,"San Francisco, California, United States","Hi, I’m Casey Winters, I help companies scale. I've worked on scaling multiple startups to large technology companies as an employee and as an advisor. Most recently, I was the Chief Product Officer at Eventbrite, where I led the PM, product design, research, and growth marketing teams. I helped Eventbrite navigate the pandemic and focus our strategy, becoming more product led, improving developer velocity, and making the shift to helping event creators grow their demand.

I started the marketing team at Grubhub and scaled Grubhub's demand side acquisition and retention strategies. We built a city expansion playbook and compounding loops of sustainable growth with low or no CAC and strong retention. This helped drive Grubhub from 3 cities to 1,000+ and from a $1 million series A to an IPO and $7.3 billion exit.

After this, I joined Pinterest and led the growth product team. I joined amid a shift from a social network to a personalized recommendations system, from social driven growth to SEO, and from U.S. only to international first. Pinterest had 40 million active users. We turned SEO into a scalable acquisition strategy, increased conversion to signups/mobile 5x, and replaced our email and notification system for scale. Pinterest now has over 400 million active users with the majority of them outside the U.S. and is valued at over $20 billion on the public market.

I started my career as a marketing analyst at Apartments.com, and that helped me understand that the way online companies grow is very different from what you learn about in school. From there, I started implementing these strategies at Apartments.com and sister site Homefinder.com.

My experience at all of these companies has taught me to seek out and solve for the bottlenecks that prevent companies from growing faster. Sometimes, it's that the teams aren't structured properly, or that they don't have access to the right data. Frequently, they just don't where to start because it's their first time scaling a company.

Currently building Clout Kitchen, unlocking infinite scale for the world's biggest musicians and creators through AI-powered fan engagement tools. We're backed by some of the best, like a16z, Peak XV, and AppWorks. 

Before that, I've been building communities for as long as I can remember. 

In middle school: Travelled the world on weekends to cover gaming events for outlets like ESPN and Red Bull, always making it back in time for Monday homeroom (most of the time 😅). On the side, I ran Super Smash Bros. tournaments out of cafeterias and comic shops. 

In junior high: Created Southeast Asia's biggest pop culture event, CONQuest Festival, because no one else would give nerds like me a place to belong. In 5 years, it became the Comic Con of Asia -- with 100K+ attendees annually. 

In senior high and college: Co-founded the world's largest campus gaming network, AcadArena. We empowered hundreds of thousands of students across SEA and LatAm to play, connect, and learn as one of the few Series A startups to come out of the Philippines. 

Outside of work, I enjoy competitive fighting games, traveling, cooking (was on MasterChef Jr. for a grand total of 1 episode) and DJing/producing EDM! I've opened for Illenium, Seven Lions, Zedd and many more in my pursuit of bridging melodic bass and Southeast Asian sounds.

As the Founder of Breakout, I’ve spent ten years building a nationwide community of changemakers from various backgrounds via transformative experiences driven by connection. We support this unique community through a network of support, resources, and platforms.

Since 2014, we have hosted multi-day experiences in 15+ cities and cultivated a vibrant community of 2,000+ mission-driven leaders across the United States. These experiences have invested over 3 million dollars directly into the community through flagship summits and local programming. We’ve also created award-winning films telling the stories of incredible entrepreneurs, artists, & activists whom we've had the privilege of meeting through our work.

In 2017, I co-founded the Breakout Foundation, which empowers local leaders and entrepreneurs by providing them with a network of changemakers and unrestricted funding to support their communities. We've deployed over $400,000 in grants to 112 community leaders and social enterprises through the Breakout Foundation and advised on over 5 million philanthropic dollars invested in people & projects in communities we work with. 

In 2020, with the onset of the pandemic and IRL experiences on pause, we expanded our offerings from our proprietary programming to strategy and support to other mission-aligned organizations that wanted to tap our expertise around community, cities, and funding. This work has included working with mission-driven organizations such as Build in Tulsa, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Michigan Founders Fund, and Baker Tilly.

My entrepreneurial journey kicked off in 2009, when in the middle of the recession, I decided to walk away from an early career in commercial real estate at Cushman & Wakefield to join a new e-mail news start-up in the commercial real estate sector called Bisnow to grow their national events business.

My team and I are building a groundbreaking data layer that helps train and retrain multimodal AI systems effortlessly. Sounds fancy, I know, but what it really means is we’re making AI work better for everyone, everywhere.

My journey into entrepreneurship wasn’t exactly “by the book.” 

I quit my job just 2 years in, took some bold risks, and learned everything on the go— sometimes the hard way. But here’s the thing: every setback has taught me resilience, every crazy idea has fueled innovation, and every little win has reminded me why I started.

I’m big on collaboration, staying curious, and building meaningful solutions that actually solve problems. 

When I’m not geeking out over AI, you’ll probably find me gardening, cooking up new recipes, or playing PlayStation (yes, I still collect toys). These little joys keep me grounded and recharged for the wild ride of running a startup.

At the end of the day, I want Future AGI to redefine how AI interacts with the world and leave it a little better than we found it.

Tandem integrates seamlessly into apps, helping users effortlessly discover, set up, and use the features they need.

My technical journey began with a deep dive into software engineering, introducing data engineering technologies in various companies. This early experience, coupled with my enthusiasm for tech, laid a solid foundation for my role as a CTO at Scribay in 2016.
 
At Scribay, I built France's largest creative writing platform, growing it to over 70,000 users and leading to its acquisition by Editis. This role enhanced both my technical and leadership skills through diverse responsibilities.

Then, I joined MadKudu as the first engineer in what was a small startup. I helped the company to grow, by opening the office in Paris, building the engineering team, setting up processes and overseeing the technical architecture, and eventually becoming the Acting CTO. By the time I left, the company had grown to 50 people. This role combined data-driven strategies, team leadership, and technical excellence to deliver impactful data solutions.

DecoverAI,Active,Kevin J. Van Horn,Founder @ DecoverAI | Driving Legal Innovation with AI,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kvanhorn01,"Arlington, Virginia, United States","We’re living in the Fifth Industrial Revolution - a transformative time where the intersection of technology (AI/ML, Quantum, Blockchain) and human ingenuity are reshaping how we live, work, and connect. I’ve spent over a decade helping organizations navigate growth, change, and complexity, and I co-founded DecoverAI to help leaders and their organizations cut through the noise, solve tough problems, and create real impact.

At DecoverAI, we are redefining how leaders and organizations navigate complexity. Having worked alongside government agencies and enterprise leaders across industries, I’ve seen firsthand how outdated, siloed tools fail to meet the demands of modern legal workflows.

That’s why we built DecoverAI - the first AI-powered Legal Intelligence Platform (LIP) designed to help legal professionals make smarter decisions, faster. By integrating cutting-edge AI into every stage of legal work and not just improving efficiency - we’re transforming how legal teams operate.

The future of technology isn’t about adding more disconnected tools - it’s about building a truly connected platform that enables seamless collaboration, enhances accuracy, and unlocking opportunities for firms of all sizes. That’s exactly what we’re delivering at DecoverAI.

I believe real growth happens outside of comfort zones. Whether in business or life, challenges push us to innovate, evolve, and lead. It’s a philosophy that’s shaped me as an executive and as an individual - whether I’m cycling up steep climbs, diving into open water, skiing down mountains, lifting heavy weights, or occasionally jumping out of planes for a new perspective.

Beyond business, I’m deeply committed to giving back. I personally support causes like the Leukemia & Lymphoma Society, IRONMAN Foundation, NCMEC (National Center for Missing and Exploited Children), and HEROES (Honor Every Responsible Officer’s Eternal Sacrifice) - organizations that are making a tangible difference where it’s needed most. At DecoverAI, we’ve implemented a 1-1-1 model, dedicating 1% of our time, 1% of our product, and 1% of our revenue to charitable initiatives, ensuring we leave a positive impact on the communities where we live and work.

The future is full of challenges and opportunities, and I’m here to embrace both. Let’s connect and explore how we can move forward, together.

Reviva Softworks began in 2012 with the creation of my first app, SnoreLab. I coined the name to invoke the feeling ‘Revitalising Health with Software that Works’. As our journey evolved, so did our vision. Since 2019, we have made breakthrough discoveries in contactless motion sensing technology using inaudible pure tones which led to the creation of our newest apps: Sleepwave and Motionscape. Today, the ‘REV’ in REVIVA invokes ‘Revolutionary’, whilst ‘VIVA’ in many languages means ‘TO LIVE’!

My journey as an app developer began when my wife complained that I was snoring, and I became fascinated by the mysterious world of sleep that we can neither see nor hear. I taught myself to code and launched the first version of SnoreLab in 2012 with no external funding. Since then, the app has been downloaded over 15 million times, helping people around the world to understand and improve their sleep.

Reviva has grown to become a true ‘family business’, run by myself and my wife, Vanessa, with a wonderful group of colleagues who are very much our family too. The company is financially self-sufficient with no external investment (and no, we aren’t looking for any!!).

For the past 5 -years, most of my time has been focussed on R&D, developing a family of technologies that we call PureTone, which is protected by an exceptional portfolio of patents. In 2022, we launched Sleepwave, a motion-sensing sleep tracker and smart alarm designed to wake people up feeling fresh. Our latest release, Motionscape, brings PureTone technology to the relaxation space with motion-sensing visualisations, games and breathing exercises that helps users engage with their breath in a more immersive way.

Mentra,Active,Cayden Pierce,Smart Glasses CEO/CTO @ Mentra,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cayden-pierce,"San Francisco, California, United States","Mentra is building the OS for smart glasses, the next computing platform.

Why build an OS for smart glasses?

Because the smart glasses hardware is finally ready. And the AI is ready. But the software is not, and building this OS is the last piece needed to unlock the next personal computer.

Why me?

Because I'm a transhumanist hacker that started building smart glasses over 6 years ago - I build systems to interface with and enhance the human mind.

And we can use smart glasses to do just that - upgrade our intelligence with AI. I believe they're the next massively adopted personal computing interface.

I've built smart glasses that sense our brains, augment our memories, and allow AI to inject ideas into our conversations.

Smart glasses to learn new languages faster, enhance doctors' decision making in the emergency room, and upgrade our conversations.

I like to say ""I make cyborgs."" But actually, we're already cyborgs.

And I may be cyborg Exhibit A. I built a mobile hacker lab RV to serve as an extension of my body. I existed as this cybernetic vehicle and drove across North America.

One stop along the way was Wolfram Research, where we tried to understand if LLMs represent meaning in the same way our brains do.

The last stop was MIT Media Lab where I built custom wearables and proactive AI agents with the aim to augment our cognition. 

And finally, today, I'm in SF and Shenzhen leading Mentra. We're building the OS and apps layer for the next personal computing interface. Check it out: https://Mentra.Glass.

Kumar is a neurodivergent whose passion for neurodiversity advocacy stems from her life experiences growing up as the sister of a nonspeaking autistic individual named Vikram and ADHDer herself. After 27 years of being unable to communicate his thoughts, Vikram learned how to type through an accessible letterboard. Uncovering his vast intelligence and eloquence inspired Kumar her to search for a solution to the need to empower those who society has overlooked. 

At Georgia Tech, Jhillika founded Mentra: the world’s largest neurodiversity employment network. After understanding the innate barriers to employment through community driven research, Mentra focused on the candidate experience to built a tech-platform that intelligently matches neurodiverse individuals with inclusive companies that value their unique abilities.

In 2019, Jhillika was recognized for her work and won the AbitaB.org Student of Vision Award, where she delivered a Keynote speech at Grace Hopper to an international audience of women in technology. In her captivating speech, she called upon the audience of 15,000 women and young girls to leverage the power of empathy and technology to enable the one billion people who live with some form of a disability today. In her video, she brought awareness to the neurodivergent community that is often sidelined by society’s policies, technologies and employment opportunities. 

In 2018, Jhillika delivered a TEDx talk where she shared “You know what’s ironic is that I’ve learned most of my lessons from a boy who has never spoken a word in his life, ever,” she told the TEDx audience. “And if there is anything at all that I would like to do in this lifetime, I would like to take the lessons my brother has taught me and show to you how much he, and the neurodivergent community, have to offer to this world.”

You know …

- Using Newspaper Ads
- Purchasing Billboard Ads
- Waiting On Referrals
- Networking, etc...

The raw reality is if you continue down this path, it will only end in struggle and despair.

Treading water to stay afloat.

I don’t say this to be ‘pessimistic’ … I say this to inform you and help you evolve.

Charles Darwin once said: “It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent who survives, but the ones most adaptable to change.”

Yes, using newspaper ads can be great. Yes, you can buy advertising space on billboards, wait on referrals, and yes, you can even network 24/7... all of which will get results (to a degree)…

- BUT -

If those are your PRIMARY ways of acquiring clients for your business, you are seriously falling behind.

This industry isn’t changing; it’s already changed.

Never has it been SO EASY to generate new clients for your practice. The world is literally accessible at your fingertips!

I mean, the internet has changed everything for attorneys.

You can now EASILY & PREDICTABILITY generate new leads and clients each month by simply leveraging technology to set up the right Machines to do all the prospecting & heavy lifting FOR you.

And the number of people you or your office staff can message or talk to in a day will no longer be your playing field. The entire country is.

With the playing field wide open, you no longer have to fight with your competition! Instead, you’ll finally be at ease knowing you have new leads and clients flowing in daily who are interested in working with you RIGHT NOW.

And the best part?

The industry establishment hasn’t caught on…

So for the few in this new frontier, it’s created an entire valley of golden opportunities & competitive advantages to be exploited.

In 2005 Sadok decided to return to the gaming market in what became the biggest online poker startup of Turkey, oyunsalonu.com, valued at above $100 Million.

After the Turkish market was regulated, looking for new opportunities Sadok co-founded with Saran Holding, a large media group in Turkey, the first social betting venture in the world, tuttur.com, that has now gained a 15% market share against fierce competition. This success led the local media group to fund a digital section of which Sadok became the CEO. The first acquisition of this corporate entity being a sports portal which since the acquisition grew ten fold in becoming the second largest independent sports portal in the country.

In 2013 he took a role as head of innovation at bwin.com, largest betting company in the world as an outside counsel and startup products owner.

In this period Sadok also has made few angel investments: a gamification platform (actapi.com), a same day delivery service (kapgel.com) and a Edutech company (Twin Science). He also has recently took a board seat of xfire.com, a competitive esport tournament platform based in Los Angeles.

Sadok has launched a new worldwide startup called betbull.com in 2017, based on the success of the Turkish social betting platform, and innovative products he introduced to bwin.

At careCycle (YC W25), we're revolutionizing how Medicare agencies retain members through AI voice teams that deliver personalized member care at scale. 

After architecting 100+ contact center automation projects and witnessing thousands of missed opportunities daily, I realized the problem wasn't about replacing agents—it was about empowering them.

Our multi-agent AI teams have helped leading FMOs write $2M+ in renewals while reducing agent talk time by 20% per sale. We've proven that AI can handle the entire Medicare member journey with 5x higher conversions and 37% better retention rates.

My journey spans building AI solutions across 50+ countries as the first U.S. hire at AI Rudder, to now creating purpose-built technology specifically for Medicare's unique workflows and compliance requirements.
I'm passionate about three things:
1. Giving Medicare agents back 1 million hours in 2025
2. Building technology that truly delights seniors
3. Transforming member retention through consistent, personalized care

So, where have I been for the last 21 years? 

Well, I’ve been gainfully self-employed, diving into the world of digital innovation. For years, I saw LinkedIn as a place to find a job—which I didn’t need—so I only logged in occasionally. 

Until late 2022, I was the Co-Founder of Bare Feet Studios, LLC, alongside the incomparable Roxanne Darling. In 2002, we relocated BFS to the beautiful island of Oahu, Hawaii (and later to Maui in 2011), where we built a thriving social media and website consulting business, collaborating with companies and state agencies across the U.S. 

Through our award-winning, ahead-of-its-time (2006) video series ""BeachWalks with Rox,"" we traveled the country, speaking and training at conferences on what’s now known as ""Podcasts.""

Fun fact: I was among the first 32 people in the world recording audio podcasts back in 2004. Adam Curry, the ""Podfather,"" and Dave Winer created a directory and private message board for early ""audio casters,"" and I was right there at the start.

Fast-forward to late 2022: Roxanne and I parted ways (still close friends and co-parents to our rescue pup, Mama Sita), and I've ventured out on my own while Roxanne continues to gradually wind down BFS after an incredible 28-year run (as of 2024).

Now, I’m channeling my 41 years of programming experience and 30 years as a Database & Information Systems Architect into creating cutting-edge, component-based, professional-grade Notion Information Management Systems through my new company, INEO Media, LLC.

On top of that, I’m embarking on a grand solo adventure, slow traveling the world full-time starting December 30, 2024. My first year will be spent exploring SE Asia: Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, and the Philippines.

I’ll be documenting my journey as a Digital Nomad on two new YouTube channels:

@EasySlowTravel – Your go-to for organized, well-planned full-time travel tips.

@MobileTravelCreator – Tutorials and how-tos on the tools, software, and techniques for video shooting & editing that support EasySlowTravel. Plus, advice for anyone looking to systematize and streamline their productivity and content creation.

From publishing on computer vision in IEEE to founding three revenue-generating startups, I’ve been in the AI and robotics game long before it became hot. Now I’m combining real-world robotics with scalable software to tackle one of logistics’ biggest problems: the driver shortage.

📈 Traction, Not Just Talk
Our L2+ autonomous vehicle is already live-tested on London roads. We’ve launched a Co-Pilot Program, lined up 10 trial logistics fleets, and we’re preparing for full L4 deployment under the UK’s Automated Vehicles Act.

Robotics as a Service — just £199/month for L2+ today, scaling to full L4 for £899/month. It’s B2B. It’s recurring revenue. It’s a business built for scale.

We’re raising £1M under SEIS/EIS to expand operations, onboard more trial users, and accelerate regulatory clearance. If you back deep tech, robotics, or the future of transport, let’s talk.

Vic is a General Partner at RRE Ventures and CEO of Originalis. A builder at heart, Vic founded four venture-backed startups and co-founded Eniac Ventures, dedicating his career to building and backing technical founders at the earliest stages. He is a thematic investor, focused on the AGI frontier and exploring its foundational building blocks—LxMs, the unstructured data stack, open source and decentralization. 

For 15 years, Vic was instrumental in establishing Eniac as a top-performing early-stage venture firm, scaling from a $1.5 million Fund I to over $500 million in AUM across seven fund vehicles. As an entrepreneur, Vic built startups in AI, consumer, developer tooling, and mesh networking. His previous startup, Kanvas, was successfully acquired by AOL, and his latest, Originalis, is the intelligent composable operating system for private capital markets.

Vic began his career as a full-stack software developer building enterprise-grade systems in supply chain and ERP. He started his venture capital journey at RRE, DFJ Gotham Ventures, and Chart Venture Partners.

Born in Guyana and raised in Jamaica, Queens, Vic’s life journey shapes his gritty, grounded approach to building and investing.

His journey began in Queens, New York, where he grew up. He attended Townsend Harris High School, a top-ranked magnet school known for its rigorous humanities-focused curriculum. This strong foundation in humanities was complemented by his time at Columbia University, where he majored in Industrial Engineering and Operations Research.

At Columbia, Rohan found his true calling in technology and entrepreneurship. He was one of the lead developers for Columbia Spectator Publishing and actively participated in Columbia's Organization of Rising Entrepreneurs and the Application Development Initiative Labs, which solidified his passion for innovation and development.

After graduation, Rohan joined Citi as a Quant in the equity derivatives division. At Citi, he developed tools for trading and worked extensively on the equities C++ pricing library, enhancing the bank's trading strategies and risk management capabilities. His career took a significant turn when he joined Citi's selective internal startup incubator, the Markets Acceleration Lab. In this role, Rohan became the first developer on a small team working on building Citi's internal crypto analytics platform—designed for firm-wide adoption and eventually to be spun out as an enterprise SaaS product to be sold on Wall Street.

In parallel, Rohan was pursuing a Master’s in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning. He decided to leave the program to join Antler's startup accelerator, where he co-founded Enoki, a company focused on creating the ""Figma for developers."" This venture marked his deep engagement with the Linux open-source community and heightened his appreciation for open-source development. After a small exit from Enoki, Rohan is excited about continuing down the entrepreneurial path and exploring opportunities in challenging and high-barrier industries.

Rohan continues to be actively involved in open source, with an interest in AI agent development and its applications, particularly in the public and private capital markets spaces. His expertise spans AI, machine learning, Linux development, DevOps, and full-stack development.

The Challenges Sales Leaders Face in Senior Living

🚨 Move-ins take too long: Seniors and their families delay decisions, leading to empty rooms and lost revenue.
🚨 Reps miss critical follow-ups: Reps miss key steps, lose track of leads, or fail to engage decision-makers at the right time.
🚨 Referral sources are overlooked: Key influencers like doctors, financial advisors, and community leaders impact move-ins, but reps rarely engage them consistently
🚨 Sales processes are inconsistent: Top reps excel, but others miss opportunities due to lack of guidance.

The best sales leaders don’t just track activity—they coach their teams to take the right actions at the right time. But in a fast-moving sales environment, leaders can’t be everywhere at once.

My journey has centered on blending a deep passion for AI, machine learning, and distributed systems to build transformative B2B data platforms. I’ve been fortunate to help startups grow from their earliest stages, guiding them through challenges and milestones, and gaining invaluable insights into what it takes to scale a technology company.

My focus on B2B data has shown me how AI—especially generative AI—can unlock new opportunities for efficiency and growth that traditional methods often overlook. I thrive on discovering and building solutions that empower B2B companies to do more with their data.

Each venture has deepened my understanding of product development, go-to-market strategy, and the critical intersection of technology and design.

Because your clients need you, not just efficiency.

Too many organizations are being sold on AI as a replacement strategy. Cut costs. Eliminate roles. Automate everything. But here's what they're missing: in a world where anyone can access the same AI tools, your human judgment, relationships, and intuition become your greatest competitive advantages.

I started Woz Digital after seeing too many small to mid-sized organizations (specifically those heavily reliant on service) caught between two extremes: falling behind technologically or losing what makes them valuable to clients in the first place.

My philosophy is simple: don't outsource your intuition.

With 10+ years of guiding companies through digital transformations, I've learned that the best AI implementations amplify human capabilities rather than replace them. I help clients across a broad range of industries with everything from manufacturing to insurance to PR and beyond create 1:1 client experiences that competitors can't replicate—because they're built on both smart technology and irreplaceable human insight.

My approach? Human-centric AI without disruption:
• Strategic AI integration that preserves what works
• Workflow enhancement that empowers teams rather than eliminates them
• Change management at a pace your organization and clients can trust

At 15, Davide was selected to represent Costa Rica at United World College (UWC) in India, where he received a holistic, multicultural education focused on peace, diversity, and global responsibility.

There, he crafted his own major in Creative Entrepreneurship, combining studies in art, economics, and social innovation. It was at Bennington that he founded DAVIDE, a gender-inclusive denim brand with a strong focus on sustainability, fair labor, and artistic expression.

Having multiple paths to achieve this, I chose entrepreneurship to make it happen, specifically, technology-based entrepreneurship. That's how I ended up in the incredible world of startups. 

I firmly believe that it is easier and faster to build in community, that's why I always try to teach and share what I learn, and leverage and build bridges with others around me. 

That's why I created SoyStartup with my brother, a community of 80K operators and founders of startups in Latam, and then I joined Latitud, the pre-seed fund and community of 1K tech-backed founders.

My zone of genius is in the early stage of a company where execution and making things happen is key. I have created and scaled products from pre-seed to Series A in regulated industries in emerging markets such as Brazil, Mexico and Colombia.

In my corporate life I worked at Red Bull and Mastercard, and in the tech world at Polymath Ventures, Lana (spinoff of Cabify) and Latitud. 

Currently I am founder of taxflow, a startup based in San Francisco with which I seek to free people and companies from the complexity of filing taxes, starting with helping the 90K accounting and tax firms in the US to implement artificial intelligence in their workflows.

In both roles, I saw smart people waste hours on tedious work:
→ Copying numbers
→ Formatting decks
→ Triple-checking the same data across countless documents

That’s what led me to co-found Lucite.

We discovered a similar (but even more painful) story in insurance.

Brokers were buried.
→ Re-entering the same data again and again
→ Parsing dense, inconsistent, ever-changing insurer documents
→ Under pressure to get it all exactly right

One slip?
It could mean huge financial exposure or uncovered risk for a client.

So we built Lucite to fix it.

We automate broker workflows end-to-end:
→ Extract the right data
→ Flag discrepancies
→ Generate clean, client-ready outputs across quotes, renewals, plan designs, and claims

No complex onboarding.
Just powerful tools that work from day one.

Lucite is built for group benefits brokers and advisors.
So they can finally spend less time in documents and more time advising clients.",27,,Co-Founder & CEO,Lucite,Investor,WestCap,Investment Banking Analyst,J.P.

Stormy,Active,Stormy Simon,"E-commerce Pioneer, Entrepreneur, Corporate Executive, Cannabis Activist",https://www.linkedin.com/in/stormy-simon,Las Vegas Metropolitan Area,"Stormy Simon is unlike any other c-suite executive. She’s a glass-ceiling shattering e-commerce pioneer, corporate renegade, cannabis activist, and public speaker who went from being hired as a temporary employee and worked her way up to President of a $2B company with worldwide recognition.

A celebrated business leader, Stormy recently launched Mother Ruggers, a brand-new venture in the textile industry, debuting a line of rugs and home furnishings with partner Ayse Yildirim, a fine art design and textile expert from Turkey.  The two mothers, on different continents, realized there was an opportunity to disrupt the market by providing luxurious, affordable, and easy to care for rugs for every mother. Combining their talents, they are thrilled to bring their products exclusively to North America, with plans to expand internationally. 
 
Mother Ruggers is a new line of washable, one-step, anti-slip, affordable, and quality rugs.  Simon Yildirim is a revolutionary, jacquard woven luxury line, that is also machine washable.  Upcoming brand extensions include Rugaroos, a line for kids, and PattieO, durable yet chic rugs designed entirely for outdoor living. 

A sought-after speaker and panelist, Stormy delivered the keynote address at the Aspen YPO Conference in 2019 and debuted an inspirational TedTalk in 2018.  An unconventional leader who went straight into the workforce, bypassing college and business school, she has been featured throughout the media landscape in outlets including Inc., The Washington Post, Forbes, SF Chronicle, MSN, Cheddar, Yahoo!, Entrepreneur, PopSugar, CNBC, and Fox Business.  
 
Active across multiple industries and disciplines, Stormy currently serves as Executive Director of the Board of Mission Green, a nonprofit organization that works to free non-violent cannabis offenders from federal prison.

At Kimaru.ai, we’ve built a Decision Intelligence Platform designed for the real world - not labs. Our customers don’t need more dashboards or theoretical AI. They need precise, trustworthy recommendations that plug directly into existing workflows and help them act with confidence.

Here’s what we solve:
• Missed margin from blanket markdowns or static pricing
• Inventory leakage from preventable stockouts, overstock, and spoilage
• Strategic blind spots from siloed data and Excel-driven firefighting

💡 Even the most skilled Excel teams quietly lose revenue to these issues.
Kimaru.ai changes that - surfacing hidden opportunities and risks, and delivering them in a clear UI built for humans, not data scientists.

✅ Seamlessly integrates with ERP, WMS, RPA, Excel, APIs
✅ Empowers decision-makers with human-in-the-loop workflows
✅ Provides full audit trails, scenario modeling, and real-time updates
✅ Built to complement - not disrupt - how your team already works

Learn how Decision Intelligence Platforms help you:
• Add millions in recovered margin
• Improve inventory turnover by 20–30%
• Reduce preventable stockouts by 40%
• Spend far less time in reactive “spreadsheet mode”

📍We’re live across Japan, the U.S., and APAC, working with retailers, consumer brands, vending operators, and supply chain teams.

If you're managing operations, pricing, or planning and suspect there's more value buried in your data than you can currently act on - let’s connect.

Outfox Health,Active,Beth Ann Lopez,Founder at Outfox Health | Custom AI copilots for health plans & employers | Harvard MPH | WEF Technology Pioneer,https://www.linkedin.com/in/balopez999,San Francisco Bay Area,"I believe healthcare should be accessible and affordable for everyone. Yet healthcare is complicated. Costs are not transparent. The US spends the most on healthcare in the world while people are sicker than ever.

We created Outfox Health to empower people with transparency. We help you compare provider prices and understand your health benefits so you can make informed choices about your care.

How I got here:

• Studied biochemistry at UNM. Took the MCAT and was ready for medical school until losing several family members to diabetes (including two aunts in their 30s). Was so frustrated by the poor quality of healthcare they received in rural New Mexico. As a 6th generation New Mexican, I joined the Peace Corps to gain perspective and worked at a clinic in Cambodia.

• Realized that the root of most health problems isn't about medicine - it's about broken systems. Shifted my career goals and went to Harvard School of Public Health for graduate school.

• Joined a tech startup and grew a platform for pharmacists to thousands of users within months. Got addicted to the speed and scale of digital health. Started my own tech company in Vietnam and helped millions of people get care.

My mission is to make healthcare understandable and transparent for all Americans.

Thus, since I was a child, I decided to get involved in it as much as possible.

My high school education, focused on electronics, allowed me to carry out many interesting projects, such as launching experimental rockets and building autonomous sumo-fighting robots. Robotics became my passion during my teenage years. I became a national champion in the discipline, and in 2016, along with a friend and our coach, we won the international ""Robotraffic"" competition at the Technion Institute in Israel.

But after all of this, something inside me told me that I could use all the technology at my disposal to make a more useful and direct impact on the world.

And that’s how Háblalo was born: a mobile application designed to help people with communication disabilities. Although I was happy with my small, homemade project, I wanted to take it to a larger scale. That’s why I decided to co-found the social technology startup Asteroid alongside my partners Laura and Sergio.

Thanks to our work at Asteroid, Háblalo now assists over 500,000 people with disabilities in 65 countries, completely free of charge. Additionally, we have transformed the customer experiences of 50+ multinational companies by making them accessible, establishing a new standard for inclusive service. In 2024, Asteroid received investment from Globant Ventures to ensure our international scalability.

Although my role as CEO of Asteroid is my primary job, I am also the co-founder of Apgreid (Ed-tech) and Grondplek (Constru-tech), a speaker, a two-time best-selling author, a teacher, and an investor.

I believe a better planet is possible through technology that prioritizes humanity’s needs… and I strive to bring that philosophy into absolutely everything I do. Always, from Argentina to the world.

I am a Software Engineer and have graduated from Delhi Technological University. I have been a developer ever since I was 12 years of age who is an Open Source enthusiast and a coding fanatic. I am deeply passionate about software development and working with extremely talented people to collaborate and make products that would make an immediate impact. I enjoy hacking things up for any immediate problems or projects I want to pursue. For example, I spotted an oligopoly of premium music service providers, I immediately created a web app to solve this issue for good. I always have a holistic approach while building an app. I do not get obsessed by a single aspect of the app, rather I wear multiple hats until I am able to ship a product.

Most of my personal projects always come from a problem I want to solve, and it is by solving that problem that I grow and develop my coding abilities. I always break down the problem into smaller pieces and work my way up using learning the necessary tools to complete it. I have an excellent work ethic and I enjoy solving difficult challenges and learning from them. 

I served as a Teaching Assistant at Stanford University for CS106a in 2020, Google Summer of Code Intern in 2018 and a Mentor in 2020 as well. I work part-time as a Full Stack Developer at FOSSASIA and a Full Stack Mentor at Udacity. 
Being well versed in API architecture and security, it makes a complete Full Stack Developer. I recently had a publication(https://apisecurity.io/issue-41-tinder-and-axway-breached-equifax-fined/) on finding a significant vulnerability in Tinder’s main API and bypassing their only premium model.

Marketing teams typically manage a large amount of content from both internal and freelance sources. Customer support teams typically lack a single unified inbox for all customer inbound digital questions, comments, and complaints.

Thyme,Active,Robin Shah,"Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer at Thyme Care",https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-shah-8072bb35,"Nashville, Tennessee, United States","Friends (and friends of friends) regularly reach out when a loved one is told they have cancer. All ask me the same question: “What do I do now?” “Where should I go?” People seeking reassurance and answers during their most vulnerable moments shouldn't have to rely on an “insider” for guidance—and truthfully, most don't have access to an insider.   

At Thyme Care, we share a passion to create a better, more connected care experience for everyone affected by cancer. We built a value-based oncology model with an integrated ecosystem of care navigators, social workers, oncology groups, primary care groups, and health plans that put people first. Our approach connects providers, payers, and patients at every step, making cancer care easier to understand, navigate, and access. And our connected ecosystem with AI-powered navigation features provides support across the complete spectrum: through diagnosis, treatment, and recovery, while also addressing their mental, emotional, administrative, and socioeconomic needs. Our approach is driving a future in care where providers are preventative care strategists, payers are health optimization partners, patients are co-producers of their health, and digital technologies are core to healthcare infrastructure.

This work is deeply personal and fuels my passion for transforming healthcare systems. Before Thyme Care, I was a founding member of OneOncology (later acquired by TPG and AmerisourceBergen Corporation, now Cencora), where I focused on provider development, marketing, and technology integration. Earlier, I helped reshape how oncologists leverage real-world data at Flatiron Health (later acquired by Roche), and the beginning of my oncology journey started when helping manage my father's comprehensive community cancer center. 

These experiences have taught me that business success and societal impact go hand in hand. Whether it’s breaking down data silos to empower decision-making or addressing systemic barriers like access to transportation and mental health support for cancer patients, I’m driven by the idea that businesses can—and should—be a force for good. 

Each experience has built upon the last, laying the foundation for my purpose and mission: identifying and creating connection points that catalyze meaningful change in healthcare.",38,,"Co-Founder, Chief Executive Officer",Thyme Care · Full-time,Angel Investor ,Multiple Startups,OneOncology,3 yrs 11 mos,The Johns Hopkins University - Carey Business School,"Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.), Medical Service Management",The George Washington University,"BS, Biomedical Engineering",Business Development,Oncology,Healthcare,Hospitals,Healthcare Information Technology,5,,Speaker at HLTH 2022 event; Guest on Oncology Onward podcast; Guest on Slice of Healthcare podcast; Interview on YouTube with Health Business Group,,7.0,positive,,,,Co-founded the value-based oncology platform Thyme Care; Recognized in Fierce Healthcare's Fierce 15 of 2024,L4,"Robin Shah demonstrates a strong track record as a proven operator with significant experience in high-growth healthcare technology companies.

HR teams are buried in paperwork, hiring managers waste time, and bad hires cost companies huge amounts of money ($1.1T per year, according to Gallup).

After 20+ years in HR, fixing hiring problems at scale, I built PropulsionAI to help organizations define what success looks like before hiring, make faster decisions with clear steps, evaluate employees fairly, make jobs meaningful, and keep their best people.

Having led HR across five different industries, I've seen how broken hiring processes and poorly designed jobs slow growth. I help HR leaders and hiring managers get real results by combining AI tools with proven methods from real-world experts. This focused approach keeps companies lean while creating jobs that give employees purpose, meaning, and ways to grow.

Who We Help:
❇️ HR Leaders shifting from tactical admin work to strategic workforce planning.

❇️ Hiring Managers who need clarity in role design and structured hiring processes.

❇️ Growth-Stage Companies scaling without adding unnecessary HR complexity.

HR should drive business growth—not just process paperwork.

What People Are Saying:
💬 Integrating AI technology with a results-oriented approach enables us to design roles that foster accountability and ownership. That attracts the top candidates. (Wes Kubik, Senior VP, Human Resources)

💬 We have long anticipated tools that not only support our leaders but are also user-friendly and efficient. (Dana Hotchkiss, VP Talent Acquisition)

💬 I wasn't expecting that role design would become such a powerful anchor for setting expectations and setting up my team for success. (Vina Rathbone-Falvey, CEO)

Redouble AI,Active,"Martin Bittner, MD, DPhil, MBA",CEO Redouble AI (YC S24)︱Automating complex workflows with AI,https://www.linkedin.com/in/marbit,"New York, New York, United States","AI and the promises of what it can do seem to be everywhere - and yet, the reality inside companies speaks a very different language: 90% of pilots never make it to production, and the countless off-the-shelf AI tools that claim to be plug-and-play never deliver the promised RoI. But there is a better way:

I have spent the past decade developing automation solutions for complex enterprise workflows, seeing first-hand what it takes to automate the myriad of processes that drive biotech, pharma, and other highly regulated industries behind the scenes, and what leads to actual value creation. This is what I have learned, and the basis for what we build and deploy with our partners:

1) AI is inherently and categorically different from software - it is probabilistic, not deterministic, in nature, and thus requires a very different way of adoption that prioritizes ensuring dependability, reliability, and verifying the validity of its outputs.

2) AI's most powerful ability is also its Achilles heel - the ability to learn and adapt, from data, and from humans. This means adopting AI is more akin to hiring a junior employee, who needs training and oversight, but then becomes an invaluable member of your team. Human plus AI beats pure AI any day of the week. 

3) Each and every company is different - there is no ""average company"" for whom a generic solution will do. The key is using AI in a way that it mirrors and augments your current processes, instead of forcing the adoption of someone else's way of doing things. 

4) AI in isolation is useless - instead, its value is derived from being deeply integrated into your data and across your organization, so that it can actually help in your day to day. 

5) Regulated industries are paranoid about data privacy and security - and rightly so. Supporting comprehensive permissions, authorizations, and the most stringent security protocols is not optional, but a prerequisite from the get-go. 

About me: an MD-PhD-MBA by background, for the past ten years I have successfully been automating the most complex workflows in biopharma, healthcare, and financial services as a two-time founder - having built and led my first company all the way from inception to VC funding to profitability in the UK, and now leading my second YC-backed venture in the US.

Beyond the fund, I independently advise and invest in start-ups including Diem, Clay (Acquired), Cooper, Hively, Culina Health, Conceive, and Rocco.

I am an experience designer with a passion for understanding people and creating great experiences. With an eye for strategy, my focus is on understanding the challenges and needs of users to first and foremost create value. 

Having studied and started my career with marketing, I sought experiences which would give me a well-rounded human centred approach. This search brought me to the UK, where I spent a year in a market research firm understanding the ins and outs of interviewing people and teasing insights from data. To augment this, I completed studies in UX design ensure that my work is user focused and looks to solve pain points. 

I have experience in multinational corporations, market research, digital agencies and in start-ups. 

In my work I focus on four key areas:

-	Communicating: I excel at presenting, facilitating and stakeholder management. I focus on bringing out the story to help the team understand the user’s challenges
-	Creating: I focus on thinking outside the box and bringing a fresh approach to problems. Combining data and creativity, I look to create solutions for users.
-	Connecting: I always look to connect with the user, to understand the true pain points beneath the surface to ensure the solutions we create fulfil their needs. 
-	Collaborating: I enjoy working with cross functional teams and across boundaries to find solutions which are better than what we could have made individually. 

Outside of work, I have a passion for mindfulness and continuous improvement. I’ve been involved in hackathons and I enjoy networking and learning new perspectives.

His own international student journey began in 2010 where he got his Masters in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo. Realizing the opportunity international students had at their fingertips, he helped his brothers, Meti and Massi, navigate the same complex process of applying to study abroad, and the three of them founded ApplyBoard in 2015. 

Martin served as CEO of ApplyBoard from 2015 to 2022.

I’m Toly Sherbakov, founder, builder, and probably the guy who’s failed more times than he’s won. But hey, that’s the game.

⭐️ Right now, I’m in California, launching Casy—a simple workspace for freelancers and small teams. More on that soon.
But let me backtrack a bit:

In 2014, I joined a team building AR stuff, and by 2015, we launched Awespace, a custom AR/VR studio. We worked with a billionaire, sure, but the projects for kids and museums? That’s where the magic was.

2017 came, and we launched Faradise—an AR furniture marketplace. Raised $1.5M. A year later, we got acqui-hired. Boom, team sold off, product handed over. Quick exit, but we weren’t done yet.

In 2019, we relaunched Faradise in the US, got into an accelerator, raised more cash, started making money... and six months later, we had to shut it down. Lesson: Money doesn’t solve everything.

By 2020, we pivoted, brought back the studio as Magic Quick, and launched Magic Kids, an educational game for 4-8-year-olds. Raised $500k, got on CBS, Fox News, ABC. Things were looking up.

In 2022, we launched Magic Playbox for custom AR/VR products. It did OK, but we paused it after a year. Not every idea is a winner.

And in 2024, we made the call to shut down Magic Kids. That’ll be a separate post. Lessons, struggles, the whole thing.

👀 A couple of extra facts:
Got my O-1 visa to the US in 2021 (apparently, I’m “extraordinary,” or so the paperwork says).
Never applied to Forbes 30under30 or any of that hype.
Ditched my PhD to chase startups full time.

Now, I’m 33, starting Casy, and the journey’s just getting crazier. I’m ready for the wins—and the inevitable failures along the way. ""I’ll believe in each day like a mom believes in her kid.""

While not reaching unicorn status, he has proven operational capabilities and a successful small exit, fitting the L4 'Proven Operators with Exits' category.

Been doing start-ups since 2012. Created public transport monitoring service “ETransport” and launched it in 33 cities in Russia with MAU 300 thousand of users. I completed the IIDF (Internet Initiatives Development Fund) acceleration program and after that I learnt of how to develop IT-products in an integrated manner: from building «product-solution-fit» (through Customer development) and «product-market-fit» (through testing marketing hypothesis) to working with unit-economics and virality. Sometimes I work as a tracker and mentor for IT-startups. Opened and closed about 15 businesses plus 3 projects were implemented and introduced to single clients. While working with IIDF (2015-2019), I studied start-ups all over the country, communicated with its founders, tested hypothesis and learnt it’s test results. I know sticking points of most business models, can offer ways to solve any product problem.

My last project was a digital procurement platform for the developers. I had a team of 36 people, my main goal was the company growth: from searching for key people, learning customers, forming MVP and testing general hypothesis at first to budgeting, strategic planning and management developing lately. Relationship with the investor, business processes and organizing cooperation between team workers were my permanents duties.

I realize how business works. I can find unforeseeable solutions. I know how motivate my team. I have my own reality distortion field where I can see the new ways of development. I have a vast outlook on digital opportunities as I studied business processes of more than 2500 real businesses and now have a good eye for start-ups and network in this sphere.

Prior to Contio, Klein was the founding CEO of Riskalyze, which started in his basement in 2011. It rebranded as Nitrogen after Hg Capital became its majority owner in 2021.

Cheers,Active,Brooks Powell,"CEO @ Cheers | $70m revenue, #1 on Amazon, 30k retail locations, & 75% YoY Growth! 🥂🍾",https://www.linkedin.com/in/brooksapowell,"Houston, Texas, United States","I started Cheers nearly a decade ago while I was a student at Princeton University. After reading about the discovery of the alcohol-related properties of our hero ingredient, DHM, I couldn't think about anything else. Within 2 weeks, I decided to make a major career change, from Baptist minister to entrepreneur, and dropped everything to begin working on Cheers. 

I knew DHM was the future for the alcohol industry, and I believed that I had a unique responsibility to bring it to market in an ethical way. Starting in 2014, Cheers became the first company selling purified DHM at scale in the United States.

While getting this DHM formula into the hands of drinkers is a good thing, how you bring it to market is of the utmost importance. The fact of the matter is that even responsible drinking can lead to feeling less than 100% the next day. I believed that we could promote the use of DHM in a responsible way and ultimately create a category called ""alcohol-related health""—which Cheers would be the crown of. 

Our human studies with DHM revealed that it was most effective when combined with cysteine and other ingredients. Today, these formulas are covered by US patent #9,603,830 (granted). Our big, hairy, audacious goal is ""A Billion Better Mornings by 2035."" With 25 million doses already sold, we're 2.5% there already.

When used in a proper way, alcohol is a good thing through its ability to bring people together. We work each day to promote the good of alcohol while reducing the bad. Our mission is ""bringing people together through promoting fun, responsible, and health-conscious alcohol consumption."" Our vision is ""a world where everyone can enjoy alcohol throughout a long, healthy, and happy lifetime.""

Cheers is a force for good beyond the health benefits of its products. We are building a generation of “smarter drinkers” who know more about alcohol, ways to be responsible with it, and how to make room for it by being healthier in other areas of their life—such as eating less sugar, more fiber, opting for healthier fats, and exercising more. As we like to say: “You need to earn your right to drink.”

While I started Cheers, today the company is filled with some of my best friends and lieutenants who have made the company their own. Cheers has expanded far beyond myself. It's our team, our shareholders, our network of partners, and most importantly our customers that make this company great. I couldn't be more grateful for the loyalty and joy that we have built around Cheers.

Everyone was solving faster, but no one was solving better.

That’s how Pullse was born, to help CX teams automate the repetitive, surface real-time insights, and focus on conversations that actually build trust.

Today, as Founder & CEO, I’m building a platform that makes customer experience less reactive, more human, and radically scalable.

With a background in speech pathology and community advocacy, Khylir spent years serving families in underserved schools before shifting into entrepreneurship. After launching and managing two small businesses in real estate and hospitality, she returned to her passion for supporting others—this time from the lens of motherhood.
The idea was born from Khylir’s own experience: during pregnancy, she found herself overwhelmed, unsupported, and spending long nights searching online for answers and care options. A particularly frustrating attempt to find a proper prenatal massage highlighted the glaring gap in maternal support systems. Her second pregnancy, which she experienced through home-based midwifery care, was calm, personalized, and healing—proving that a better model exists.
Khylir created the maternal wellness app to bring that model to every mom—especially those who often feel unseen. She envisions a world where care is accessible, culturally competent, and brought right to a mother’s doorstep. Her leadership is guided by compassion, advocacy, and a deep reverence for the power of women.
