We build robots that actually get work done. By equipping practical, wheeled-base humanoids with the latest LLM intelligence, we make them adaptable to any problem in any warehouse. Unlike wobbly bipeds, our bots are smart, speedy, scalable, and safe to work alongside humans so we can solve today's labor shortages. I've shipped over 25,000 robots at my previous startups, and my co-founder Ed Lando has founded unicorn startups that have raised hundreds of millions. But with just $2M raised to date, Kinisi is pioneering the future of physical intelligence where we don't mimic human biology — we outperform it. 

If you ship fast and want to see your work in the real world, not just in demo videos, reach out here https://www.kinisi.com/careers


I've spent the last 15 years founding robotics startups because I hate inefficiency. I turned my childhood bedroom into a robotics lab and started the UK's first robot fighting league while working in warehouses and factories. But after a job made me unscrew 1000 screws manually, I knew my mission was to build practical bots that take hard labor off of people's shoulders. 

I spent a decade in academia, researching humanoid locomotion for my PhD, before founding Bear Robotics. Funded with $180M by investors like SoftBank, we built waiter bots that delivered millions of meals to tables. But without AI, they had to be hard-coded for each restaurant and struggled when tables were rearranged. So I spent two years advising top robotics startups while learning to design LLM-powered hardware before recruiting a team from Nvidia and Dyson.

Exceptionalism: “If you want to break into a market, you must provide a truly exceptional product that is 100x better or enables something just not possible before.”

Respect: “We are fortunate to voluntarily interact with others. Showing respect for our colleagues, customers and vendors is paramount, whether it is being on time for a meeting or recognizing the strengths and accomplishments of others.”

Gratitude: “We all have gotten where we are through the help of others. Building a new type of processor for deep learning required many groups of people working together toward a common goal. It’s a team sport. We go out of our way each day to thank those who have helped us along the way.”

Using these principles, I have led teams to introduce a host of “first of type” product areas, from semiconductors to systems that were successful in a wide range of industries, including mobile, enterprise core, networking, mobility, broadcast video, as well as consumer products sold at the Apple store.

We are convinced that to really make an impact, we need to focus on primary care.  Every person interacts with primary care as their entry point into the system and it is the unifying thread that ties together disparate preventative and curative efforts across all fields of medicine and health.

A tenet that permeates our entire culture at Curai is belief in the power of data to transform medical decision making into a process backed by evidence.  Artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies have matured to the point that this is practical.

We are using our experience in creating consumer products to create tools that patients can use to truly understand their health concerns and issues, and we’re investing heavily in natural language technology to understand exactly what a patient is saying so we can make sure they are actually being heard.  But doctors are a core part of healthcare, and our system integrates with health professionals to enable them to helping patients as effectively as possible.

To join us on our journey, feel free to reach out :D

StoryFile,Active,Ceci Chan,🔥 Your happiness is my priority. I support overwhelmed professionals to feel alive and full of possibility again. Let’s connect. 🌱,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ceci-chan,"Great Malvern, England, United Kingdom","I’m here for the pause. 
The moment you remember there’s more to life than getting through the day.


In 2020, I burned out completely.
I had the titles, the career, the credentials. But inside, something was missing.
Even in a job I once loved, I woke up each morning feeling drained.

So I paused.
And began the quiet, powerful work of coming home to myself.
Not to fix anything, but to feel again.

I explored psychology, coaching, yoga — even hypnosis, tarot, and astrology (you name it!).

And what stayed with me and transformed me entirely, was the kind of clarity that comes from truly knowing myself.

Now, that’s what I offer others.


🌿 I support overwhelmed professionals to feel alive and full of possibility again, through holistic coaching and intentional, joyful action planning.

I bring together psychology, holistic coaching, and lived experience into a space for your whole self to be held, nurtured, and expanded.

Whether it’s through 1:1 coaching or accessible, heart-aligned digital resources, my work is here to help you soften the noise, reconnect with what matters, and move forward. With ease and joy.

BigSpring,Active,Bhakti Vithalani,"Founder & CEO at BigSpring. McKinsey, Siebel, Wharton, Carnegie Mellon alum | WEF Tech Pioneer",https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhaktiv,San Francisco Bay Area,"My life’s work is to equip people to be job-ready in a rapidly changing world.

I grew up in Bombay, where anyone walking down the street has asked: What’s the path forward? Study-work-retire leaves most people behind. Later, at McKinsey & Company, I saw the same problem in business: companies struggled to turn business plans into on-the-ground results. Why? Because we equip people for jobs with training and it’s BS—“death by content,” “spray-and-pray,” “check-the-box”.

BigSpring AI is disrupting that. We solve for three essentials:

🎯 Adapt to change
On BigSpring AI, enterprises don’t just onboard people—they everboard them to meet evolving business needs. We start with the latest job needs, not the content, so people stay relevant and ready.

💪 Measure job-ready, not test-ready
We don’t track “Did you watch the video?” or “Did you pass the test?”
We measure, Are you ready for the job?
BigSpring AI measures muscle memory, not activity—because that's what drives results.

👩‍🦰 Design for the user
Just like YouTube is tailored and social, so is BigSpring AI. The platform understands each person’s muscle memory metrics and builds a personalized onramp. Think of it as a personal CrossFit program for work—targeted, flexible, and designed to help people grow in real time.

BigSpring AI is fueled by doing well and doing good. A platform that adapts to change also unlocks social mobility—anyone can become anything.

Inkbit,Active,Davide Marini,Technology Entrepreneur | CEO @ Inkbit,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmarini,"Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States","I am an entrepreneur naturally attracted to solving ambitious and technically complex challenges that require the convergence of different disciplines, especially chemistry, biology, computer science and engineering. 

A rather nonlinear career path led me to cofound and lead Inkbit, an MIT spinout that developed Vision-Controlled Jetting (VCJ), a scalable additive manufacturing process that can build complex, multi-material objects in a single print, eliminating the need for assembly. The development of VCJ required converging state-of-the-art techniques in optics, chemistry, and computer vision. The technology was published in Nature.

Prior to Inkbit, I had the fortune of being invited to cofound and lead Firefly BioWorks, an MIT spinout that developed a novel assay for multiplexed detection of microRNA on standard flow cytometers. The technology relied on individually encoded and DNA-functionalized hydrogel microparticles manufactured by flow lithography. The technology was published in Science.

Prior to Firefly, I was a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School and Children's Hospital Boston, where I developed nanomaterials for sensing and drug delivery applications in the area of ion channels.

I obtained my BS in Industrial Engineering from Politecnico di Milano, my MBA from Collège des Ingénieurs in Paris, and my PhD in Mechanical Engineering from MIT. Prior to attending graduate school, I worked on a fixed-income derivatives trading desk at J.P. Morgan in London.

Given my schedule, I can only afford one mind-resetting activity: I am a competitive épée fencer (USFA C2024 rating). If I had more time, I would invest it in more fencing, cycling, skateboarding, archery, astrophotography, playing piano, writing Lisp code, studying physics, history, architecture, ... Some of these interests are at least useful in composing the annual trivia at the Inkbit Christmas party.

I tend to lead by engagement to ensure all the knowledge and creativity of the team flows into making effective decisions. I am intensely curious of how other people think and strive to create an environment where that richness can be fully realized.

Skills: exploration, finding order in chaos, creating a path through uncharted territory, reading manuals when all else fails.

Matt's Story: 

Matt’s passion for solving social problems began through his volunteer work mentoring youth from under-resourced communities across Chicago. In 2017, after mentoring more than 20 individuals, he recognized a deeper systemic issue: the lack of coordinated access to workforce resources, job opportunities, and support networks. This realization sparked the idea for RiseKit—a software platform designed to transform how nonprofits, employers, government systems, and community foundations collaborate to find, train, and support job seekers. RiseKit not only saves time for workforce stakeholders but also captures powerful data to help communities and cities organize more effectively around economic mobility.

As Founder and President of RiseKit, Matt continues to lead with the core belief that a person’s zip code should never define their future. He’s always eager to connect with innovative, mission-driven leaders who share his vision for equity, systems change, and social impact.

Matt brings over a decade of experience in community engagement, volunteerism, management, social entrepreneurship, sales, and fundraising. He also mentors and advises emerging social impact entrepreneurs, helping them navigate growth and scale their missions.

In his free time, Matt enjoys spending time with his wife, volunteering with local nonprofits, cheering on Chicago sports teams and Liverpool FC, playing pickleball or golf, and relaxing with family and friends.",34,,RiseKit,Full-time · 7 yrs 8 mos,Executive Advisor & Coach,Strauss Impact · Self-employed,Forbes Human Resources Council Influencer,Forbes · Freelance,West Virginia University,"Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA), Finance",,,Product Development,Social Impact,Vendor Management,Strategic Partnerships,Community Management,3,Forbes Human Resources Council Influencer,Speaker at SHRM Conferences; Contributor for The Sociable; Guest contributor for Spiceworks News & Insights; Mentor at Ed Kaplan Family Institute for Innovation and Tech Entrepreneurship,,7.0,positive,,,,"Named Chairman of NBCUniversal Media Group in November 2024; Led the launch and growth of Peacock, the fastest-growing streaming service in the US; Oversaw streaming service Peacock, Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes, and International Networks; Helped Comcast achieve positive video subscriber growth for the first time in a decade; Led strategy and development of Comcast's Xfinity services including Emmy Award-winning Xfinity X1 guide",L2,"Matt Strauss shows characteristics of an early-stage entrepreneur with some promising initial traction.

Signal Automotive,Active,Steve Jillings,Chairman & CEO at Signal Technologies,https://www.linkedin.com/in/sjillings,Los Angeles Metropolitan Area,"Steve has more than 30 years of business-building experience, specifically in the areas of corporate finance, sales, marketing and technology. He has been responsible for eight startups throughout his career, taking them from inception to commercialization and in several cases leading to successful liquidity events.

Steve is currently the Chairman & CEO of Signal Technologies. 

Signal is transforming the $15B US vehicle import market with the first comprehensive Vertical SaaS platform for Canadian new car dealers. Signal has eliminated traditional export barriers by integrating the entire export lifecycle into one seamless solution. Our platform creates an entirely new revenue stream for new car dealers, allowing them to appraise trades and aged inventory for export to the US. The Signal platform can increase dealer EBITDA up to $5M/year. Signal is the essential engine powering cross-border vehicle exports for Canadian dealers while capturing high-margin revenue throughout the export lifecycle.

Prior to Signal, Steve was the CEO at TeleSign where he raised $79MM in growth capital and lead TeleSign to become the #1 Company in the Two Factor Authentication and Digital Identity category. Starting with 12 employees and negligible revenue, Steve grew TeleSign to 300 employees and more than $100MM in profitable annual revenue. TeleSign was acquired by BICS October 2017.

Steve was also chairman and CEO of Vantage Media, an online digital marketing firm, where he and his investment partners raised $80MM to acquire in Vantage February 2007. Vantage Media grew into one of the largest performance-based online marketers in the country. 

As president and CEO of FrontBridge Technologies, Steve took the company from a startup to a global leader in SaaS email security services. Raising a total of $28MM of funding, this allowed the team to build a broad portfolio of services combined with the largest global distribution footprint in the email security category. This lead to the successful sale of FrontBridge to Microsoft in August 2005 for more than $200MM. 

Specialties: 
 - Helping start-ups grow rapidly

1 - I would experience constant burnout because I wasn't focused on things that created energy for me
2 - I would put on a different mask depending on which constituent I was talking to because I thought I needed to be who they wanted me to be, not who I really was
3 - My decision making would become plagued by fear of making the wrong decision
4 - I didn't have a solid playbook for how to be a first time founder & CEO

Having learned these things to hard way, but ultimately having a successful exit to a public company at the end of 2021, I have now taken what I've learned, and coupled that with a worldclass coaching framework created by Matt Mochary, and spend my time coaching the world's best founders & CEOs.

My greatest passion is working with passionate founders & CEOs in their pursuit of becoming great, and building a great company. When they experience exponential growth, it changes their life. When their life changes, it has the same effect on me.

Prior to my exit with Drivably, I led a world class global renewals team at HireVue which would eventually exit for $511m to the Carlyle Group. We developed one of the most robust processes around managing renewals and took our renewal rate from 64% to 94% in a matter of 12 months. 

Prior to joining HireVue I was early an early sales leader at DOMO, where we raised $900m in venture funding, and would ultimately go public (Nasdaq: DOMO) in 2018.

His progression from early sales leader at a pre-IPO company (DOMO) to leading global renewals at HireVue, to founding and exiting his own company shows a strong operational track record.

He founded, scaled and sold two companies (most recently to NVIDIA).

He is an active investor and advisor in startups, with 55% of his portfolio companies going on to become unicorns and 80% having become unicorns or been acquired. Finally, he is also a documentary film and Broadway musical producer, with four Tony Award-nominated or -winning productions.

Laszlo was the founder and Chairman of Gretel.ai, the leader in synthetic data for AI (acquired by NVIDIA in 2025). He was also the founder, Chairman, and CEO of Humu, which used “nudges” to make people happier and more productive at work (acquired by Perceptyx in 2023). He has raised more than $150 million in venture capital funding.

From 2006 to 2016, Laszlo was the Senior Vice President of People Operations of Google/Alphabet, and a member of the executive management team. He grew the company from 6,000 to 75,000 employees while ensuring the culture remained innovative and robust. Laszlo co-led the creation of the field of “People Analytics”, the application of academic-quality rigor and Google-paced innovation to people management.

I’m also the Founder of Super AI, a pioneering company that builds enterprise-grade AI platforms where business leaders can ask questions in plain English and get insights from structured and unstructured data—instantly, securely, and without technical barriers.

I help organizations move beyond dashboards and into the era of AI Shadows—where each team has its own intelligent assistant trained on their business logic and data.

This approach is already delivering real impact:

 • In Pharma, we reduced field force reporting time by 85% using a GenAI assistant over sales ops and SFA data.

 • In Retail, we enabled anomaly detection across 10,000+ SKUs—driving a 6% margin recovery within weeks.

 • In Banking, we simplified access to risk and compliance data, cutting report turnaround times and reducing dashboard clutter by 70%.

But this transformation isn’t just for technical teams.

I believe the next generation of AI leadership will come from non-technical professionals who learn how to bridge strategy, data, and intelligence. That’s why I actively mentor business leaders, marketers, and domain experts to become AI Strategy Consultants—equipping them to lead in the AI-first era.

I’m deeply grateful for everyone who has supported this mission.

Let’s create a future where AI doesn’t replace people—but amplifies human intelligence, empathy, and leadership.

Let’s connect if you’re building an AI-first enterprise, or DM me if you’re exploring how to bring GenAI into your business or career.

My husband and I were flying home for the holidays, and with him in dental school, while I was in nursing school, we counted every penny. 
But I found a work-around; I decided to be the last one off the flight and collect the tabloid magazines left behind by other passengers. At least I would have reading material for the connecting flight. Good plan. 
I walked off the plane last, and found lots of free reading material left behind by other passengers. But I couldn't bring myself to pick it up. I was so frustrated with myself for not being able to afford a $3.99 magazine, that I no longer cared to know what priceless fashion celebrities were wearing to their events when I couldn't even afford to buy the magazine that was reporting it. 
I headed up through first class to exit the plane and noticed that all the reading material changed. Instead of discarded tabloid magazines, it was Wall Street Journal, Entrepreneur, and Inc. magazines. In that moment, it all fell into place for me: the reason the first class passengers were sitting in first class was because they were focused on building, creating & growing, brands, companies & solutions, while the passengers in coach who had left behind tabloid magazines- were focused on being entertained. 
I did an instant 180 on my priorities. I took all the reading material left behind by the first class passengers. I started studying innovators instead of celebrities. I gave up popular music & started listening to venture podcasts, audio books, & the vast amount of business content on YouTube, being mentored by the giants of the entrepreneurial world- for free.
My paradigm shifted. I started to look at big problems in my industry as potentially big solutions waiting to be found & scaled. As I moved from bedside into leadership positions, I experienced the daily struggle of procuring staff quickly and within safe, cost efficient policies. I saw a better way, & found my calling.
Leaving the fast paced adrenaline filled life of trauma/critical care nursing was tough. The mental challenges & daily inspiration are everywhere in the clinical environment. I thought I would have to double down to find it in the quieter work spaces of technical teams. I was wrong.
Healthcare innovators share the same passion for patient care as my colleagues working at the bedside; from spending years with little sleep & pay to bring improvements to market, to the emphasis on quality & improving access.. it's a daily source of joy & inspiration.",39,,"Founder, CEO",Dropstat · Full-time,Chapter Director: HealthTech Industry ,Startup Grind · Part-time,Resource Team Nurse- Critical care ,UCLA Health,University of Maryland School of Nursing,"Bachelor of Science - BS, Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse",Towson University,,Patient Satisfaction,Staff Scheduling,Healthcare Staffing,Medical Staff Relations,Nursing,3,,Interview on Cache Flow Podcast episode 50 discussing healthcare efficiency and Dropstat's impact; Featured interview on Valiant CEO discussing Dropstat's mission and technology; Multiple blog posts and articles on Dropstat's website highlighting Sara Well's leadership and vision,1000,7.0,positive,,,,"Founded Dropstat, a healthcare staffing automation company; Led HealthTech community at Startup Grind",L1,"Based on the available information, Sara Well appears to be a first-time founder who has transitioned from a clinical nursing background to entrepreneurship.

I see things...
The best way to predict the future is to create it yourself!

It’s best to do more than you think you know, than to think you know more than you do!

AI without data is a brain that knows nothing.

The beginning of learning is humility.. 
because it starts with accepting you might not know what you think you know!! 

You are the sum total of all the thoughts you've ever had in life and you are where you are RIGHT NOW because that's where you want to be, whether you want to admit it or not. 

Worry is the negative use of the imagination. Visualization of your dreams is the positive use of the imagination. Your brain and nerves don’t determine which to focus on, they just react accordingly... whichever you focus on is up to you!

It’s best to remember that the entire population of earth minus one exception, you, is composed of other people.

Choose a dream bigger than yourself so you either have to give up or get help.

Before Veryfi, I was wearing multiple superhero capes: crafting HIPAA-compliant solutions as CTO at VectorCare to revolutionize healthcare logistics, and hunting down digital coupons at Coupons.com like they were Crocs in the wild.

But wait, there's more! Back in the Land Down Under, I cut my teeth at AMP Ltd (Australia's FinTech heavyweight), where I got to learn from the Jedi masters of corporate architecture. They showed me all the secret passages of financial services - from planning and strategy to banking and tax. And yes, I even ventured into the ancient arts of COBOL (fun fact: I once taught Object-Oriented COBOL at uni - please don't hold it against me! 😅).

EIO Diagnostics,Active,Damir Wallener,Make something people love,https://ca.linkedin.com/in/damirwallener,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","TLDR: Currently working on a generative AI replacement for traditional game engines like Unity. This includes rolling my own models (transformer, ViT, Masked ViT, traditional R-CNN, LSTM, DETR), creating/managing custom datasets, and MLOps on remote GPU nodes. Most recently, I created a tight coupling between a 3D renderer where the AI takes a walkabout in the virtual world, learning as it goes along. This included both realtime and ""sleepy time"" continuous training loops.

For emphasis - none of this is loading models from HuggingFace with ""pretrained=true"". These are all custom models and custom datasets. I learn fast.

I have also created a screening tool for Obstructive Sleep Apnea using craniofacial classification. It is currently in early stages of field testing.

I am an experienced technical manager/executive with a history of shipping product across multiple domains, including AI, Gaming, Adtech, Agtech, Fintech, and Consumer Electronics. I've handled customer engagements as small as an 8-cow dairy farm in Northern California to a formal/funded Joint Development with Samsung. Highly literate in both software and hardware. 

My strengths include the ability for intense focus on product market fit coupled with rapid development iteration, working closely with early users and dev teams. This is a skill that crosses all domains - I am a connector with deep technical skills who loves to work in the intersection of things and teams. 

I have significant fundraising experience (7-figures and counting!) that leverages my skill in creating highly effective narratives that resonate with investors/customers. I am very fortunate to have added the requisite softs skills without losing my HW/SW design background - the ability to put myself in the customer's perspective, while maintaining enough technical competence to prototype the first versions of a solution has been a very powerful combination. 

I have very strong business development and product management experience coupled with a degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech.

Dr. Lin's interest is on fundamental research of AI including Multimodality Signal Understanding, Big Data Graph Computing, and Computational Social & Cognitive Science. 

The human brain is a giant graph of 100 billion nodes and 1 trillion edges, performing four major functions: memory, observation, judgement & perception, and abstract reasoning & strategy. Graphs are our natural way to remember, correlate, and understand all that surround us. For more than a decade, our researchers and developers have been devoting ourselves to advance artificial intelligence technologies based on mimicking brain-like graph infrastructure. Our technical strength falls in these 8 categories: Linked Big Data, Advanced Visualization, Autonomous Learning, Cognitive Feeling, Machine Reasoning, Strategic Thinking, Human Understanding, and Prediction.

We focus on creating novel AI solutions, especially in Finance and Medical. http://www.graphen.ai

Before starting Graphen, Dr. Lin created IBM Research's Network Science and Machine Intelligence department. His team created IBM's first Finance AI product -- Surveillance Insight.

I was previously the co-founder and CTO of Reverie Labs, a small molecule therapeutics company that used machine learning to drive a pipeline of therapeutics in oncology. As a founder, I grew our company to a staff of 30, built a culture of technology and engineering that marries computer science with chemistry, and raised $31M from top investors to fund our internal therapeutics pipeline. Reverie Labs was sold to Ginkgo Bioworks in February 2024.

I’ve built and managed a multidisciplinary team of engineers, scientists, and managers spanning machine learning, data science, backend and frontend engineering, cloud infrastructure, and cheminformatics. I have been hands-on in writing code (and then building teams to write code) for all of these disciplines.

In an earlier life, I graduated from Harvard and studied computer science. For my thesis, I built machine learning models for DNA structure, and I was advised by Professor Alexander Rush of Harvard NLP and Dr. David Kelley of the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT. I was deep (pun intended) into the deep learning world throughout my academic training, including being a head teaching fellow for multiple Harvard courses in machine learning.

With over 50 patents and 80 publications in journals including Nature, Nicholas’ seminal work on quantum and classical information processing with integrated photonics has helped launch the international research field of programmable photonics. In 2021, MIT Technology Review honored Nicholas with the Innovators Under 35 award, selected by 30 judges—including Andrew Ng—from over 500 nominees. Past winners include Google’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Apple’s Jony Ive. He received his doctorate in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he was a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow and then a Postdoctoral Fellow through the Intelligence Community Postdoctoral Fellowship.

---Perspective---
My career has been focused on understanding computers—how they work (down to the atomic scale) and where they are headed. During my time at MIT as a PhD student and post-doctoral fellow, I explored what may become the ultimate tool for understanding the exquisite details of our universe: quantum computers.

As co-founder and CEO of InOrbit, the leading platform for robot operations, I have the best job ever: I get to help robot developers around the world tackle the most challenging tasks IRL and help end users across industries improve the efficiency of their operations. To do that, I drive awareness around a new category we call RobOps: like DevOps, for robots 🤖.

I took a winding road to get here. From hardcore engineering, working on obscure topics like image processing and crypto, to launching video products used by over a billion people, with a detour through digital health and productivity software. Along the way, I was granted over 20 patents; founded and joined startups; did stints at some of the logos everyone recognizes like Facebook, Microsoft and Adobe; negotiated and closed major deals; raised multiple rounds of funding and developed relations and friendships around the world.

Now I focus on impact at scale + giving back to the community. Whether it's writing articles (including for my LinkedIn newsletter ""Welcome to the Roboverse"", on Forbes.com or industry mags), starting the preeminent community group for robot operations (ROG - pronounced ""rogue"" of course), interviewing industry experts, or serving on the board for the Silicon Valley alumni association at UC Berkeley, I aim to share the key trends that will impact not just the future of work but the future of everyday life. Hint: I believe it involves robots and immersive tech.
 
I'm passionate about product management and entrepreneurship. I'm happy to mentor, advocate for and invest in the next generation of startup founders. I am a connector and booster, so if you are a founder trying to get connected in Silicon Valley feel free to reach out.

I strongly believe that when leading a team it is my responsibility to provide any opportunities for growth and guidance that I can. I push to promote balance and ensure my teammates are fulfilled in their work and subsequently their personal lives. My role should provide challenging problems that excite people rather than bore them with a traditional routine. I never ask of others what I am not prepared to do myself. I also believe that strong leadership comes from having experience with what you are meant to lead. Learning and being a part of the project helps ensure I am not the figurehead who leads from an office but instead gets their hands dirty and shares my experience and knowledge with my team.

My journey began in a small town where the slow pulse of dial-up internet sparked my first venture—an endeavor born out of necessity and a passion for online gaming.

As a teenager, frustrated by the limited connectivity, I embarked on a mission that would mark the start of my entrepreneurial path. I negotiated with a local ISP to run a dedicated T1 (1.5 MB/s) line more than 30 miles out to my parents’ house. This was more than just about improving my gaming experience; it was about breaking barriers and creating opportunities not just for myself but for my entire community.

To afford the $2,000/month fee, I transformed our basement into a tech hub, setting up a network of Linux & Windows servers. What started as a personal fix soon evolved into a full-fledged business, providing web hosting, game servers, and VoIP services. The company quickly scaled, hosting hundreds of servers and thousands of websites. Prior to leaving for college, I decided to sell the business. While the return was nice, the experience that tested my limits early on was worth exponentially more.

After graduating, I joined Rackspace in San Antonio, deepening my skills in cloud computing and enterprise solutions. My passion for esports then led me to create Leaguepedia, a resource for fans of League of Legends that quickly became a cornerstone of the esports community, attracting over 10 million monthly users within just six months.

Following the sale of Leaguepedia to Twitch/Curse, I continued to innovate, playing a pivotal role in building their esports division. My next venture took me to Azubu and then Unikrn, where I led significant tech and marketing overhauls, further shaping the esports landscape.

In 2017, I embarked on an ambitious journey through startup accelerators, eventually founding Esports One in Boston’s MIT PlayLabs. After relocating to Los Angeles, we developed a revolutionary Fantasy Esports platform that utilizes real-time computer vision and deep data analytics to enhance user engagement in the DFS/Gambling markets.

Now, back in Austin, I am leveraging my extensive experience to launch a new AI startup. I am dedicated to solving complex problems in the tech industry, mentoring up-and-coming entrepreneurs, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. I look forward to connecting with like-minded professionals who are driven to innovate and make a significant impact through technology.",39,,Chief Executive Officer,Vertical Labs · Full-time,Founder/CEO,Esports One · Full-time,Founder/CEO,Esportspedia · Full-time,Auburn University,"Bachelor of Engineering - BE, Computer Software Engineering",,,Agentic,Cryptocurrency,Video Games,Venture Capital,Business Strategy,3,,Interview on Tech Company News about Esports One and its technology; Blog post on Esports One blog discussing Web3.0 and esports innovation; Featured in podcasts discussing esports and technology entrepreneurship,0,7.0,positive,,,,,L4,"Matt Gunnin demonstrates a clear pattern of successful entrepreneurship with multiple ventures and at least two confirmed exits.

There are many obstacles. 

Even if you've collected data, it's hard to know where to start.

Current AI tools require expensive and hard to find data scientists yet they don't understand the physics or practice of manufacturing.

AI needs to be trained, but rarely is there enough data about the exceptional use cases.

Every plant is a special snowflake - different configs, different sensors, different work processes, different software.

AI needs good clean data, but plant data starts out dirty (erroneous, missing, misaligned, mislabeled)

We have a goal of making manufacturing more reliable, efficient, and autonomous.

Our  team combines physics, mechanical, chemical, electrical, and petroleum engineers with world class software and AI experts.

Our approach is to combine the best of physics/engineering understanding with the latest in data driven machine learning.

Our solutions are not incremental, they are wildly new and innovative, such as:

A new analytics language for the digital twin - the Digital Twin Query Language. 

A digital twin accelerator that takes complex physical simulations and makes them 10000x faster.

A multi-variable closed-loop controller leveraging AI/ML that continuously learns and improves with operation.

Peritus.ai,Active,Robin Purohit,Software Executive/Entrepreneur,https://www.linkedin.com/in/robinpurohit,"Los Gatos, California, United States","My 30-year career as a executive and serial entrepreneur spanned the IT stack from chips and scale-out infrastructure to software/SaaS to data/AI at startups and iconic public companies. 

Born in Canada, I started my first software business in high school and joined Nortel Networks after graduating University of Waterloo to develop advanced semiconductors during telecom boom. I then joined my first startup in Toronto which was acquired by HP in 1995. After moving to silicon valley, I became a product management executive at two iconic public software companies, VERITAS Software and Mercury Interactive, leading growth initiatives to $1B+ annual revenue and M&A exits for $20B in total.

Re-joining HP through the Mercury acquisition, I became a GM/P&L executive first transforming an $100M Information Management business to double revenue and reach profitability in 2 years. I was then promoted to lead a $3B IT Management portfolio with 4 business units through the 2008 financial crisis to generate over $1B in annual cash flow and dramatically simplify the solution offerings, spearhead the transition to cloud computing, and a lateral expansion into the enterprise security market via the acquisitions of Arcsight and Fortify.  

Most recently, I have served as a C-suite executive/board member at PE and VC-backed startups, including a private equity turnaround at Group President at BMC's $1.3B Enterprise Software Business and early stage exit at Griddable.io (acquired by Salesforce). As advisor/investor, I have had successful exits with Moveworks (acquired by ServiceNow for $2.8B) and OpsRamp (acquired by HP Enterprise).

On hiatus from full-time work, I continue to advise investors/startups in Infrastructure Software, Enterprise AI, and Canadian tech ecosystem while tackling my personal bucket list.

I built my first startup GuideBuddy in 2013 while starting a Ph.D. I lost 2 years and made $0 from it.

I didn’t know how to build a product that my customers really wanted. I wasted 100s of hours building the wrong features, and talking to the wrong people. Eventually, I lost 1000s of dollars of my own money.

I shut down Guidebuddy in 2015 and vowed never to make the same mistakes.

In 2017, I finished my Ph.D. and started SIERA.AI with a $50,000 grant from the US government.

I spent over 3 months just talking to 100+ customers and learning their true pain points.

What happened over the next 5 years changed my life:
- I raised ~$7M of venture capital
- Built a team of 30+ people across 2 continents
- Launched 2 successful AI and Robotics product lines to 1000+ devices
- Scaled a go-to-market program, and onboarded over 60 enterprise customers
- The largest deal we sold was worth over $300,000.

In 2022, I handed over the CEO reins of the business. 

In 2023 I joined Shield AI. First I led the software team that builds Shield's AI pilot and then in 2024 founded the customer engagement team for our Hivemind Business.

Since launching Hivemind Customer Engagement at Shield, we've helped close double digit millions in revenue in a matter of months and scaled the team to handle domestic and global sales engineering, post sales applications engineering and customer success.

For one of these projects, I created an unique algorithm and related infrastructure that improved crawl / indexing quality significantly for Web Search. I left Google when I found it's difficult to focus on things I like to do.

I co-founded Camect with Arup in 2017, trying to solve a problem that we both feel annoyed: security cameras were barely usable. There are too many different brands of security cameras, each has its own app. Some of them even upload user's video to cloud. Yet none of them produce useful alerts. Tons of garbage alerts that force users to disable them. We would like to have a privacy oriented system that can manage all security cameras. Most importantly, it should generate only useful alerts! This is what Camect is about, a private, secure and open security camera service/software that produces accurate alerts. Currently, we are focusing on building a B2B business in the security monitoring space.",44,,CTO and Co-Founder,Camect · Full-time,Software Engineer,Google · Full-time,,,University of Chinese Academy of Sciences,"Master's degree, Computer Science",University of Science and Technology of China,"Bachelor's degree, Computer Science",MapReduce,Distributed Systems,Algorithms,Linux,Python,0,,,0,0.0,neutral,,,,Outstanding Achievement Award of University of Florida (2016); Graduate School Doctoral Research Travel Award at University of Florida (2016); Keynote speaker of the National Psychological Conference; PI of two Major Projects of National Social Science Foundations; Berggruen China Center Fellow,L3,"Chao Liu demonstrates strong technical expertise and senior-level experience at a major tech company (Google) with 10+ years of experience.

Alpha Drive,Active,Steven Wolfe Pereira,CEO @ Alpha • Advancing AI Governance for Board Directors,https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfepereira,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Steven Wolfe Pereira founded Alpha to solve a critical problem: most boards are governing AI transformation without the frameworks, intelligence, or peer networks they need to make sound fiduciary decisions.

Alpha delivers what directors actually use: proprietary governance intelligence, executive-level AI education, and access to the most AI-experienced board members navigating similar challenges. Our clients include public and private company boards facing AI decisions that will define their competitive position and regulatory exposure for the next decade.

Wolfe Pereira brings relevant operating experience: 25+ years driving technology transformation, including $5+ billion in strategic transactions as Chief Marketing Officer at AI-first companies Datalogix (acquired by Oracle, $1.2B) and Neustar (acquired by Golden Gate Capital, $3B). His executive leadership spans Publicis Groupe, TelevisaUnivision, Quantcast, and co-founding the award-winning edtech company Encantos. He began in private equity at Blackstone Group and Salomon Smith Barney and started his technology career in 1999 joining Akamai Technologies in their network infrastructure engineering group. 

Currently serving as an independent board director at the Latino Community Foundation, Save the Children, and Whalar, Steven understands governance challenges from both an experienced operator and the boardroom perspective. His AI governance insights have been featured in major business publications, and LinkedIn named him a Top Voice.

You and I are blessed to be on our journey through life on this beautiful planet.

We don't get to choose everything, but we do get to choose how we will respond to everything life throws at us--or offers to us.

To maximize our time on the earth, we need to understand our identity--who we are and why we are here.

Alex Haley, author of Roots, said that in each of us there is a ""deep hunger, marrow deep, to discover our heritage, to know who we are and where we came from.""

We started Ancestry.com in 1996/7 so more people could discover their family stories. Much of our identity and resilience comes from deeply knowing and appreciating our ancestors--and what they did to get us here.

Another part of our individual identity is our natural talents.

Gallup invited me to evangelize the global strengths movement for nearly 5 years. I studied the teachings of Dr. Don Clifton, the father of strengths psychology and grandfather of positive psychology, and met great people who were taught and trained by him.

Today, Soar's mission is to unlock the potential of billions of human beings.

Learning—and then applying what we learn to achieve—is the key to our growth.

The TAM for global learning and training is close to a trillion dollars.

But most of it seems to be wasted. We remember a tiny fraction of what we learn. So much training is quickly forgotten or never applied.

The Soar AI Platform is changing this.

When you learn something important, you can invite our AI tool to help you apply what you learned and get feedback on your journey to mastery. 

As you pursue mastery, the Soar PRISM AI will personalized the feedback to your strengths.

Professional athletes get to watch game film with a coach to improve their performance. 

Imagine being able to design your own AI that knows you, your talents, your goals and dreams, and helps you achieve them. 

AI is being used by trillion dollar companies to get you to click, to like, to play, to watch, to scroll — endlessly and mindlessly. 

It’s time for you to take charge of your own use of AI.

I’m building the missing layer between humans and everything they interact with. Especially themselves.

Where society isn’t something we survive — but something that actually helps us grow.

My journey has taken me from the jungles of Papua New Guinea to the more staid boardrooms of multinational corporations in New York, always with a focus on empowering leaders to navigate stakeholder challenges and reach robust, mutually beneficial outcomes. 

My crisis management experience began with leading the communication response to what was described as ""Australia's first terrorist attack"" - the bombing of the National Crime Authority's Adelaide office.

MicroByre,Active,Maggie Brown,"Senior scientist, previous co-founder",https://www.linkedin.com/in/magnumbiology,San Francisco Bay Area,"I am a passionate researcher that focuses on the chemical processes upon which biology stands. Early on, I began training in synthetic organic chemistry at UIUC. I then met ""biology"" (!!!!) joining the research lab of Professor Michelle Chang at UC Berkeley as her first class of PhD students. There, I focused on elucidating the mechanisms by which bacteria break down and consume the plant aromatic polymer, lignin. I gained extensive experience in molecular biology and protein chemistry performing a wide range of protein purifications, assays, and analytics. I learned how to think about host requirements (cofactors, cell machinery, growth conditions) for successful protein production as well as how to perform many different methods of protein purifications and analyze them for “success”. I had to become proficient in: strain engineering design and performance, heterologous expression, non-model genomic and transcriptomic library preps, HPLC, GC-MS, spectrochemical and LC biochemical assays, anaerobic glove box usage, biosafety cabinet usage, protein purifications of tagged and untagged proteins, protein crystallography, chemical synthesis, non-model bacterial growth, and much more. For good or bad, Michelle turned me into a ""jack of all trades"".

I then joined the lab of Jay Keasling at LBNL as a postdoc bioengineering bacteria to consume the carbonaceous component of the chemical warfare agent, sarin. This was a great time for me to develop a deep, fundamental grasp of metabolism that has deepened my foundation as a microbiological analytical scientist while honing my techniques in metabolic engineering, protein production, and protein purifications (including multi-subunit purifications). 

For the last 7 years, I have run the strain analytics group at the company I co-founded in 2017, MicroByre. At MicroByre, Sarah Richardson and I built a company of 29 dedicated employees where we isolated and engineered non-model bacteria to convert various industrial wastestreams into industrially-relevant products. We were mining the capabilities of biology!  Setting up and running MicroByre as well as the strain analytics team within it meant I had to constantly ask what we needed to know, how we would experimentally answer the question, and what was defined as success for that question. Due to the shaky funding environment, we were unable to continue MicroByre; however, as a series A company, we had established and were making progress on 5 joint development agreements and 3 proof-of-concept projects.

It was fast-paced, intellectually demanding and gave me a deep understanding of how businesses grow, restructure, and navigate risk. But over time, I realised I was more drawn to building something of my own than advising others on how to do it.

The turning point came while renovating my flat in Paris. I was frustrated by how difficult it was to visualise furniture and décor in context, and I couldn’t believe that in an age of digital everything, product visuals were still stuck in static photos. That frustration sparked an idea.

Today, I’m the Founder and CEO of Nfinite, a company that’s redefining the way brands create and scale product visuals. Our platform blends 3D technology with AI to replace traditional photoshoots with infinitely adaptable, photorealistic content. Whether it’s a new sofa, a pair of trainers or a seasonal product line, our clients can bring it to life online in any setting, from any angle, with zero logistics.

As a result, we’ve built one of the world’s largest libraries of high-quality 3D datasets. These datasets can enable the training of AI to not only see but deeply understand the physical world through spatial awareness and object relationships. This is what I call Physical AI - an essential leap forward in creating machines that learn and interact with the real world. 

It’s been a journey of resilience, from bootstrapping the early days to partnering with a number of the world's biggest brands and retailers. Along the way, I’ve learned that the future of commerce is immersive and the future of AI is physical. I’m passionate about building the tools that empower bright minds to dream bigger and move faster.",35,,Founder - CEO,Nfinite,Lawyer,Gondran de Robert Avocats,Assistant Professor to Pr.

Since Cultivate launched in 2019, we’ve served more than 300 organizations to recruit and train diverse talent, recruiting more than 17,000 candidates, and placing more than 300 candidates in full-time roles in the social impact sector.

Prior to founding Cultivate, Sarah was the managing director at ACRONYM, where she specialized in organizational development and operations. Throughout her career, she has focused squarely on scaling startup teams that seek to achieve impact in the political space.

At Everytown for Gun Safety, Sarah scaled a nationwide network of distributed volunteers and managed digital campaigns for 15 states.

At Purpose, she specialized in digital strategy, mass mobilization on social media, storytelling, and analytics. During her tenure, she focused on building two major incubations for testing new models of organizing: the Climate Lab and ACLU Action. 

At the League of Young Voters, Sarah led digital communications strategy and product development. She developed a passion for product development through building TheBallot.org (social voter guide tool), and working closely to optimize TurboVote (an online voter registration product). Along with her team, she leveraged SMS, livestreams, and celebrity engagement to mobilize non-college youth to disrupt urban gun violence and halt voter suppression tactics. 

Before relocating to New York City, she worked for one of the most innovative youth engagement programs in the country, mobilizing young people to vote with New Era Colorado. In partnership with the Sierra Club, she led voter registration efforts for the Denver-Boulder area, resulting in more than 10,000 voter registrations during the 2010 midterm elections. In addition to her electoral work, she also played a role in passing Colorado's online voter registration law, and used her background in journalism to co-create an online community of young bloggers dedicated to using humor to encourage engagement in local politics.

Ople,Active,Pedro Alves,A.I. + Bitcoin + Hedge Fund = financial success,https://www.linkedin.com/in/pedroalvesds,"San Mateo, California, United States","First and foremost I am known for my immense passion for data science, machine learning, and AI. My experience in these fields range from academia, startups, my own Machine Learning Platform startup Ople.ai, and now running multiple Data Science teams at Microsoft. I have been lucky to have worked with genomic, healthcare, social media, fashion, images, text, sports, manufacturing among other data sets; as well as leveraging restricted boltzmann machines, ensembles, anomaly detection, deep learning, auto-encoders and various unsupervised and semi-supervised models over the years in my work experiences.
In building research teams and innovations in AI, including deep learning and computer vision, I have always loved research and advancing the field.  The only thing that surpasses that love is the desire for business results.
I believe AI can be an enormously beneficial tool for all businesses, and when employed correctly can return multiple orders of magnitude of its investment. AI and machine learning are tools to be leveraged by enterprises; I understand and have a deep appreciation for the fact that enabling and empowering organizations to appropriately leverage these tools is many times the most challenging barrier to success. I pride myself on my ability to make the complex simple, turning raw data into insight and working with customers to help them trust and know how to use those insights. I have experience in bringing AI into a company, growing the team and practice within an organization, and running teams. I have always enjoyed educating people of all backgrounds about the benefits of AI and AI itself. My experiences as a CEO have helped me learn a lot about all the aspects of a business outside the technical area since founding and growing a startup.
Through presenting at conferences and teaching (at universities and data science academies), my passion and knowledge of AI resonated with enough people that Ople.ai had over 30,000 applicants for our positions. One of the things I have prided myself on has been the quality of people hired and on creating an environment where team members can grow, contribute, and feel the same passion and drive as the leadership. Creating an environment where people not only respect their leaders but also feel comfortable disagreeing with them, and where leaders lead by example, not just words. These characteristics allow for the best outcomes to be achieved.

I’m a 2x founder and YC alum (S21), investor, advisor, former management consultant and software developer with a track record of building startups to reach PMF, scale GTM, and raise capital.

----

I currently lead product and deal flow at Orange DAO, the largest founder community in crypto. I’ve reviewed 8,000+ early-stage startups, managed investment decisions for 100+ teams, and advised them hands-on as a Group Partner during our 12-week program. My guidance across PMF, GTM, and fundraising has helped these teams raise over $100M in follow-on capital.

I also lead product at Launchcaster.xyz (acquired by Orange DAO), used by 15,000+ founders to validate MVPs and attract early users. I’ve built and operated full-funnel growth systems including drip campaigns, referral programs, and investor outreach that consistently drive high-quality deal flow.

Before Orange DAO, I co-founded SenpAI.GG (YC S21), an AI gaming coach for PC players. I scaled it from concept on paper to 500K+ MAUs and 1.5M monthly organic visits. My first product, FashionI, was featured by Apple within days of launch.

At Numurus, we're changing that.

My journey began with founding BlueView Technologies (acquired by Teledyne in 2012), where I witnessed firsthand how organizations struggle to bridge the gap between cutting-edge technology and practical implementation. This experience inspired our work at Numurus, where we've developed turnkey smart data solutions that make AI accessible without requiring specialized programming skills.

I believe that implementing AI should be as intuitive as installing a smartphone app. When researchers can focus on discoveries rather than code, when educators can prepare students for the future workforce without technical barriers, and when businesses can deploy smart systems without programming expertise—that's when innovation truly accelerates.

Our team has created solutions that now help organizations across sectors transform how they collect and process data, automate critical operations, and make decisions in real time.

My career has spanned scaling (and founding) multiple ventures that merge cutting-edge science with real-world impact in global water infrastructure.

As the Founder & CEO of IntelliFlux Controls, I led the development and commercialization of APRICOT — an industrial automation and digitalization software platform that optimizes process plant operations in near-real time. IntelliFlux was spun out of Water Planet, Inc., and has been deployed across industrial, municipal, and energy sector to reduce operational costs, extend asset life, and ensure regulatory compliance.

At Active Membranes, Inc., in the role of CTO, I guide a talented team pioneering electroactive membrane technologies. Our patented smart RO membranes use tunable electric fields to dynamically enhance desalination performance, reduce fouling, and enable selective ion separation — pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in membrane science and seawater treatment.

We deliver strategic advisory services, deploy advanced technologies, and lead digital transformation initiatives that help our industrial clients optimize operations, reduce environmental footprint, and future-proof their infrastructure.

Prior to joining IntelliFlux, I was the co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Water Planet, Inc., a Los Angeles based water technology and industrial water management company, which I co-founded in 2011. Water Planet  specialized in design, engineering, and manufacturing of integrated separation technologies for water treatment.

Before founding these companies, I was a Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Alberta, Canada, where I held a Canada Research Chair in interfacial and colloidal systems for water and energy applications.

I always seek to push the boundaries of what's possible in interactive entertainment and feel privileged to have collaborated with many amazing people over the years.

✅ DRIVER OF INNOVATION AND GROWTH
A start-up began with two friends’ desire to “git gud” at Overwatch, the plan hashed out over many meetings huddled in Starbucks. It ended with a product that is synonymous with FPS excellence. I wanted to harness data to empower gamers; skilling them up in a fun way and enhancing their enjoyment of the games they love to play.

The result? KovaaK’s is a platform that has maintained an ""Overwhelmingly Positive"" Steam rating year after year. This success was the product of relentless iteration and innovation, from securing rounds of VC funding to forging partnerships with industry giants like NVIDIA and releasing new features like an in-game map editor to turbocharge UGC to over 200K scenarios and playlists.

✅ SOLVER OF COMPLEX PROBLEMS
My passion for innovation didn't start there. At SEGA, I led the company's growth into mobile gaming by establishing a new business unit (SEGA Networks). The work wasn't just about creating games; it was about managing a pivot for a large gaming company while managing a product portfolio for three internal studios.

To scale, I introduced new strategic business functions like business intelligence, consumer insights, live operations, and product management.

The result? Launched 11 games in 24 months, earning millions in annual revenue.

✅ PASSIONATE SEEKER OF FUN
 Work and play shouldn’t be mutually exclusive, especially in games. At my last fully remote company, I tackled the challenge of team bonding by organizing online events: 1:1 coffee sessions, virtual escape rooms, trivia challenges and, of course, online FPS deathmatches. The resultant camaraderie helped keep attrition rates low for years. At SEGA, I was known for hosting “mandatory fun” sessions that brought teams together to mix and mingle.

When I'm not revolutionizing the gaming industry, I’m teaching my adopted pets new tricks or exploring the vineyards of Napa and Sonoma.

My curiosity knows no bounds—I've recently delved into the world of AI, earning a certificate in artificial intelligence fundamentals.

With a skill set spanning game development, product management, marketing, and team leadership, I'm always looking for the next big challenge.

The ability to own, trade, loan, customise and develop key components of a game is a game-changer and the natural next evolutionary step in the games industry. Players will move from being consumers to being fully participating members of a community with an authentic stake in the game. Players will get well-deserved real-world rewards for their time, effort and contribution to our games.

As a pioneer of the benevolent technology movement, Lyle brings over a decade of experience creating transformative experiences that merge science, storytelling, and systems design.

He began his career in the music festival world, founding The Courtiers, a creative agency that brought immersive art, sponsorship activations, and experiential design to large-scale live events. His collaborations with Insomniac, Live Nation, and AEG helped reimagine the festival experience as a platform for collective transformation.

Lyle went on to found Andromeda Entertainment, the first VR publishing label for “games for good,” where he published titles like Audio Trip and Shadowgate with leading studios and platforms. He also co-founded SoundSelf, a digital therapeutics company that coined the concept of digital psychedelics—voice-activated biofeedback experiences designed to guide users into altered states. SoundSelf has completed mutliple clinical trials and is on track toward FDA approval for the treatment of mental health conditions.

In 2021, Lyle co-founded GeniusX, securing a major grant from Meta and sparking industry-wide dialogue around the future of immersive, gamified learning.

Lyle then went on to co-found Sorceri, a custom development studio at the forefront of AI and spatial computing. Sorceri’s clients have included publicly traded companies, top-selling VR experiences, and household wellness brands, helping mission-driven teams build world-class tools at the edge of neuroscience, mindfulness, and behavior change.

Across ventures, Lyle has served as the creator, business development lead, and strategic architect behind some of the most forward-thinking platforms in wellness and tech. He has spoken on global stages including the UN General Assembly and Davos and has been featured in publications including BBC and Rolling Stone on the future of ethical, human-centered innovation.

Lyle is now the founder and CEO of ABOVE, a wearable AI company defining the category of emotional intelligence through a new frontier he calls “Reflective AI.” ABOVE offers real-time, context-aware guidance powered by voice and emotional data—supporting users in becoming more present, connected, and self-aware.

My life’s mission is to help people become happier at work. This has shaped everything I do. Over the past decade, I’ve helped 50,000+ managers at companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Shopify through live sessions, tailored programs, and practical leadership tools.

My journey started over ten years ago, when my first client was 37signals, the creators of Basecamp. I went on to spin off a product they’d developed internally into a tool that became part of Canopy’s broader platform. Since then, I’ve distilled over 50 years of leadership research into frameworks that help leaders navigate complexity and lead with clarity, confidence, and care.

Along the way, I’ve coached leaders at Apple, Uber, and other leading companies through tough moments — team dynamics, performance challenges, scaling pains — and helped them find a way forward. I’ve also spoken at conferences and led leadership trainings around the world. My insights have been featured in Harvard Business Review, CNBC, Inc., and Fortune, and I’ve taught entrepreneurship at Northwestern University, my alma mater.

At Canopy, we help fast-moving organizations upskill their managers through:

🌱 Leadership Development Programs: Live, cohort-based training tailored to your org’s real-world challenges.

💬 Coaching & Advising: 1-1 support for leaders navigating high-stakes, high-complexity moments.

🎤 Speaking & Workshops: Keynotes and interactive sessions that spark clarity and shift culture.

📱 The Canopy App: A leadership improvement app that delivers personalized daily insights, just-in-time tools, and an AI Assistant for deeper support when complex challenges arise.

Outside of work, I paint in oils from my studio in Point Reyes, California, and live in the Bay Area with my husband.

If you’re thinking about how to better support your leaders — or just want to chat about what it means to lead well in fast-moving environments — I’d love to connect.

After 3 years of helping employees share stories that helped them connect with one another internally, we realized there was a bigger opportunity.

One where the stories were not just for employees internally, but for the external world too. A company’s culture when showcased through the lens of their employees is one of the most powerful talent attraction and brand building tools out there.

Some of the world’s most recognizable brands like Microsoft, Comcast, RTX, and more are leaning on CultureHQ to help their employees stories shine.

And now today, there is even more potential. An employee’s personal brand has become not just a magnet for talent, but for customers too.

Regardless of your business size, you need to empower your people to be creating content that’s authentic and compelling.

The old ways of getting your brand known has fundamentally changed. Let CultureHQ help you tell your story to win the best talent and customers.

My current endeavor, Click Deal Buy! remains in stealth mode and soon we will come out of hiding. People tell me how passionate I am and I don’t give up after some doors are closed or the walls are caving in around me. Perseverance is my middle name. 

Having a strong background in account management for large companies or being creative about marketing is great. But my true passion is being an entrepreneur. My successes and failures could make an interesting book. I have failed only to get back up, and learn from my mistakes to try again. It’s ok to fail as long as you do learn and adapt not to make the same mistakes. 

Over the years I have invented and built products and companies from scratch. Successes and failures. Some years ago, before AI became mainstream, I had an idea, a vision about shopping. The business plan is so large and so important, why haven’t I released any software? Being pre-product and pre-revenue is the worst position to be in when raising funding. I admit, I made mistakes listening to those who promised me the world only to realize greed in others gets in the way of success. I persevered. 

Once I asked many investors and business leaders if age matters. No! was the answer. I should be retired. Click Deal Buy! is so important to e-commerce and commerce, that there was no way I would give up. The biggest lesson is to never give up on a dream. 

We, as a team, are very close to raising the necessary funds to launch Click Deal Buy! With little or no money, we’ve managed to get prototypes built, and software designed, and we met the right people to take us to the next level. The right people stopped and investigated me, my team, and of course our master business plan. The goal is to make Click Deal Buy! a household name and to drive business back to Main Street, down the street, across towns and cities. More importantly, part of our DNA is to give some of our profits to communities in need. 

For some 32 years, I worked in the Audio Visual IT Industry, starting in 1984. I held a variety of positions that have prepared me where I am today. One of the most important parts of a business I learned is Customer Service! If an error or problem happens, make it transparent as if it never happened. CDB! will have great customer service.

CallTime.AI,Active,Adam Boaz Becker,Building HeadOn - AI for Israel-Palestine. Coming soon...,https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamissimo,"New York, New York, United States","I'm a tech entrepreneur and I spent the last decade founding companies that drive societal change. 

I am now building HeadOn, a startup still in stealth mode...

I was most recently building Telepath, the world's most developer-friendly machine learning platform. Throughout my previous projects, I had learned that building machine learning powered applications is hard - especially hard when you don't have a background in data science. I believe that this is choking innovation, especially in industries that can't support large data teams.

For example, I previously co-founded Call Time AI, where we used Artificial Intelligence to assemble and study the largest database of political contributions. The company powered progressive campaigns from school board to the Presidency. As of October, 2020, we helped Democrats raise tens of millions of dollars. In April of 2021, we sold Call Time to Political Data Inc.. Our success, in large part, is due to our ability to productionize machine learning.

I believe that knowledge is unbounded, and that everything that is not forbidden by laws of nature is achievable, given the right knowledge. This holds immense promise for the future of intelligence and therefore for the future of well-being. I believe that the process of mining knowledge should be done honestly and responsibly, and that wielding it should be done with care. I co-founded Telepath to give more tools to more people to access more knowledge.

I'm fascinated by the relationship between technology, science and history. I graduated from UC Berkeley with degrees in Astrophysics and Classics and have published several papers on those topics. I was previously a researcher at the Getty Villa where I wrote about Ancient Greek math and at the Weizmann Institute, where I researched supernovae.

Locus Insights,Closed,Neno Duplan,Founder and CEO at Locus Technologies,https://www.linkedin.com/in/duplan,"Orinda, California, United States","As founder and CEO of Locus Technologies, I have spent my career combining my understanding of environmental science with a vision of how to gather, aggregate, organize and analyze EHS and water quality information to help organizations better manage their ESG scores. The result: Locus is now the leading provider of SaaS ESG, EH&S, water, and sustainability software, and outpaces its competitors in the full gamut of SaaS compliance applications.

Locus evolved from my work as a research associate at Carnegie Mellon in the 1980s, where I developed the first prototype system for environmental information management. This early work led to the development of numerous databases at some of the nation’s largest environmental sites, and ultimately, to the formation of Locus in 1997.

Under my leadership, Locus developed the world’s first commercial SaaS EH&S and water quality management system. Our software has been ahead of the curve in helping organizations in not only managing their EH&S compliance, water, and sustainability but also turning their data into a competitive advantage in their operating models and ESG scoring.

The work we do at Locus has evolved over time to encompass more and more aspects of business’ strategic planning. While a key incentive to using Locus SaaS is regulatory compliance, my team and I have taken a wider view of the mandate to improve environmental stewardship by creating systems to improve EHS+S performance across our clients’ organizational silos; regulatory programs; emission sources; energy management; all aspects of  EHS and risk, ESG reporting, and technology platforms and mobile devices. We unify EHS Compliance and ESG reporting in a single Locus Platform.

We solve our customer’s complex information management challenges for environmental, sustainability, water, and energy data using cloud technologies. We turn environmental Big Data into actionable, real-time information. Most importantly, we help our clients lower operating costs and reduce risk.

Veteran tastemakers, we are now setting our sights to grow into a global Islamic art and culture inspired lifestyle brand.

I’ve been sewing since I was eight. A love passed on to me through my mom, who taught me how to make clothes piece by piece. She also taught me to have pride in being my authentic self.

And that’s what Artizara is about: building a world where all people hold their heads high and celebrate their identity. Fashion is more than a choice in clothing. Fashion is a lifestyle.

“Let the beauty of what you love be what you do,” said Rumi. 
So, here I am, doing what I love. And every single day, I wake up excited and grateful for this opportunity.
