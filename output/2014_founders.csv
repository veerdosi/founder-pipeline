I am also 100% focused on extending healthy, productive life for everyone on the planet. By citizenship, I am Canadian and Latvian. Any kind of war is against my religion, and I can not support any kind of war, military action, or disturbance of peace. I believe that countries and people need to work together to fight diseases and make the world more sustainable.

In 2014, I founded Insilico Medicine (www.insilico.com) a global clinical-stage generative AI drug discovery. Until 2019, it was an AI-first drug discovery company, with most of the team focused exclusively on developing and applying deep learning methods to drug discovery. Insilico is the original inventor of multiple drug discovery technologies with multiple granted and pending patents in biomarker development and generative chemistry and generative biology. In 2019 the company started working on its own therapeutic programs focusing predominantly on immunology, oncology, fibrosis, and CNS. It also made its industrial-strength target discovery platforms (PandaOmics) and generative chemistry (Chemistry42) platforms available for licensing and partnering. It raised over $500 million from expert healthcare, biotechnology, and technology investors, and entered 2 Phase II clinical trials with the novel target discovered using AI and novel molecule designed using AI. Since 2019, Insilico nominated 22 preclinical candidates, 10 reached clinical stage, 1 completed Phase 2a. 

I also founded, co-chair and personally sponsor the largest global non-profit conference on aging research and drug discovery - Aging Research and Drug Discovery (ARDD), www.AgingPharma.org. In 2024, the University of Copenhagen will host 11th annual ARDD - please register early as it usually sells out in advance.

Kindred AI,George Babu,Accelerating the Critical Work of Project Developers at the New Energy Frontier,https://ca.linkedin.com/in/georgebabu,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada","I’ve had a lifelong fascination with technology’s impact on our lives, iconic products that once seemed like SciFi, and the small early teams that overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to bring new products & technologies to billions of people. Through a variety of roles at several companies and funds, I’ve explored how to spot promising emerging technologies, bring people and capital together to productize the tech, figure out how to bring them to market, and ultimately, build defensible moats around all this!
 
My early training as an engineering scientist led me to a research role at BlackBerry working on exotic antennas and skunkworks wireless chipsets for next-gen networks. Seeing a small team take on the giants with our “Crackberries”, and grow from an underdog in Waterloo to a $55 billion company serving 85 million people globally...was mind-blowing, educational...and addictive! The company’s rapid fall from grace was equally mind-blowing, educational...and humbling. 

A founding role in an enterprise SaaS company, taught me how messy, chaotic and fun company formation could be. I learnt the ropes from two exceptional entrepreneurs, David Stein and Dan Debow, worked with a brilliant team, and helped with whatever I could help with - sweeping the floors, building financial/operations models and data rooms, negotiating deals with Big Cos & VCs, getting our acquisition by Salesforce across the finish line. 

Most recently, fascinated by the promise of applying emerging deep learning algorithms to problems that have long been considered intractable...self-driving machines, learning robots, etc. I joined a group of deep learning researchers, co-founded Kindred, and spent several years talking to hundreds of companies in a quest to commercialize Kindred’s magical new AI tech & approach. We hired a phenomenal team, raised money from some of the best investors in the world, and worked with incredible customers willing to be pioneering users of Kindred’s systems. 
 
Early stage companies are messy. Early stage deep tech companies are messier still. But I’m convinced it’s worth navigating this mess to make real the potential these technologies have to improve our everyday lives. At SEV, we help founders explore go-to-market strategies, tame the FUD, and bring their visions to life.",37,,Founder,Aire Labs · Permanent Full-time,Board of Advisors,"University of Toronto, Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering, Division of Engineering Science",Gap year,Career Break,University of Toronto - Rotman School of Management,"MBA, Finance & Entrepreneurship",University of Toronto Faculty of Law,"JD, Law",Start-ups,Start-up Operations,Technology Commercialization,Business Strategy,Venture Financing,3,,,,2.0,neutral,,,,Co-founded a robotics company; Former Chief Product Officer at Kindred Systems Inc,L4,"George Babu demonstrates a strong track record as a proven operator with both successful exit experience and significant roles at notable tech companies.

For my contributions to legal AI, I was named to Forbes's 30 Under 30 and the American Bar Association's Legal Rebels lists.

In 2014, while studying computer science at the University of Toronto, I co-founded a legal AI startup called ROSS Intelligence (ROSS) with Andrew Arruda and Pargles Dall'Oglio. ROSS pioneered AI for legal research to make legal services more affordable. We raised $16.8M from investors, including Y-Combinator, and featured in publications such as the New York Times and Wall Street Journal. We served thousands of attorneys, from solo practices to AmLaw 100 law firms, such as Dentons and Latham & Watkins. For my role as CTO and the idea's originator, I was named to Forbes 30 Under 30 and the American Bar Association Legal Rebels lists. Unfortunately, in 2020, ROSS ceased operations due to a malicious lawsuit from Thomson Reuters, inspiring us to fight for public access to the law and fair competition in federal court. We have truth and justice on our side. 

After ROSS, I took a two-year break from legal tech and entrepreneurship. However, in April 2023, I teamed up with a former partner at Kirkland & Ellis, Jeff Gettleman, and my great friend and ROSS's first engineering hire, Max Isakov, to start Bench IQ. At Bench IQ, our mission is to make the law more transparent by using AI to uncover how different judges interpret it. In the United States, judges only publish the rationale for their decisions in 3% of rulings, which makes the legal system challenging to navigate. In September, we raised USD 2.1M from top investors Maple and Haystack (early investors in Instacart, Figma, and Doordash) alongside leading law firms Cooley, Fenwick, and Wilson Sonsini to realize our vision. Since launching in January 2024, we have started working with 12 AmLaw 100 firms and counting.

I’ve had a lifelong fascination for Physics. Early on in my scientific career, I became a specialist in the manipulation of light at the nanoscale – including single photon guns, quantum teleportation and holographic displays. 

While working at HP Labs on a project to route optical signals inside computer chips, my team was forced from the cleanroom due to a fire drill. On our way out, we caught a glimpse of sunlight reflecting off a sample, creating a distinctively directional image and that’s when it clicked that holographic images could be formed from the same nano-structures we’d been using in our Optical Interconnect research. Right then, Project Leia was born.

Today, as CEO and Chief Innovator at Leia Inc, I continue to evolve the applications for Leia’s Lightfield technology across mobile, retail, automotive, education, medical and beyond.

What happens when we infuse the limitless potential of space with the boundless capabilities of Artificial Intelligence?

Entering the realm of high-tech startups two decades ago, I found my fascination gravitating towards a specific intersection - space technology and artificial intelligence. The infinite expanse of the cosmos represented a playground of untapped potential, and AI was the tool to unearth that potential and bring it down to Earth.

My journey into this field began with relentless curiosity and a strong belief that AI, developed for the extreme space environment, could revolutionize how we tackle challenges on Earth. This belief manifested into a reality with Beyond Limits, where we harness space-proven AI technologies to solve complex industrial and enterprise issues.

As the CEO of Beyond Limits, my expertise lies in navigating the intersection of space tech and AI, fostering innovation, and guiding strategic investments. Over the years, I've successfully raised over $250 million in venture capital, co-founded multiple Caltech/JPL startups, and positioned numerous high-tech companies for successful acquisitions and exits.

My work is my passion, and my mission is to bring the power of AI from space programs to solve Earth's challenging problems. I invite you to join me on this exciting journey. Let's explore the frontiers of AI together.

We built something extraordinary—AI that served some of the most sophisticated in-house legal teams in the world. But despite our success, I couldn’t shake a deeper truth: we hadn’t done enough to truly change the industry.

Legal is still trapped in an outdated playbook. Even the most forward-thinking CLOs—those who want to operate like business leaders, not just legal guardians—are held back by structural constraints.

Legal know-how is scattered across inboxes, folders, documents, and memory. Strategic context—like how your company handled a high-risk decision two years ago—is often impossible to retrieve, killing leverage and making AI outputs generic at best, dangerous at worst.

Meanwhile, law firms profit from starting over, are financially rewarded for inefficiency, and most software vendors don’t go deep enough to solve real legal work.

These problems aren’t just operational—they’re existential. 90% of Americans are one legal event away from bankruptcy. And inside companies, legal is often seen as a blocker, when CLOs want to be builders.

That’s why I started Eudia.

We're not building artificial intelligence to replace lawyers. We're building augmented intelligence to empower them—to give legal teams the tools they need to move faster, think deeper, and build reusable, strategic intelligence inside the enterprise.

Eudia exists to help people achieve their greatest human potential—eudaimonia—by returning judgment back to those who must live with it: the company itself.

Our platform creates something we call a Company Brain: a continuously learning legal knowledge engine that unifies data, embeds judgment, and compounds value over time. It’s AI-native, human-aligned, and built for the strong CLO who is ready to transform legal from a cost center into a source of business velocity.

If you’re:
• A CLO looking to modernize your legal org with real AI,
• A builder who believes tech should support—not overwrite—human wisdom,
• Or someone who knows it’s time to move past legacy systems and create something different,

Let’s talk.

He has founded several influential organizations—including the Taproot Foundation, Imperative, and Board.Dev—each dedicated to building more connected, purposeful, and resilient communities. His latest venture, the United States Chamber of Connection, addresses the greatest challenge of the day - declining social connection and trust, uniting leaders and communities to strengthen civic engagement and relational bonds.

In 2023, Aaron partnered with Alethea Hannemann to launch Board.Dev, a social venture improving nonprofit governance through technical expertise. They work with large companies to train and place tech executives on nonprofit boards, enhancing board effectiveness in today’s evolving landscape.

Previously, Aaron co-founded Imperative, a venture-backed startup that introduced the first purpose profiling technology, helping hundreds of thousands of Fortune 100 employees engage with their purpose at work. In 2020, he relaunched Imperative as an enterprise peer coaching platform, acquired in 2024 by Chronus, a leader in ERG and mentoring platforms.

In 2001, Aaron founded the Taproot Foundation, which catalyzed the $15 billion pro bono service market in the U.S. and set the standard for corporate social responsibility worldwide, building cross-sector partnerships that support social innovation and strengthen communities.

Aaron’s best-selling 2014 book, The Purpose Economy, foresaw the rise of purpose as a core economic driver. In collaboration with NYU, he introduced the first measure of employee fulfillment, shaping national and global conversations about purpose in the workplace and higher education.

A recognized thought leader, Aaron has been featured in The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg TV, and Stanford Social Innovation Review. He frequently keynotes on purpose-driven leadership and social innovation. A fellow of Ashoka, Draper Richards Kaplan, and the Manhattan Institute, he is also the author of Fast Company’s ‘Purposeful CEO’ series.

Previously, I served as President of Brainspace AI (acquired by Reveal with $200 million from K1 Capital), an industry-leading natural language analytics engine incubated by the CIA.

Named a Goldman Sachs 100 Entrepreneur for “first-principles innovation across generative AI & Natural Language Processing”, I am credited in the publication of GPT-2, and my work has been covered in the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg, Harvard Business Review, and elsewhere. I have been tapped for expertise in ML/NLP, cybersecurity, and cross-border venture capital by the National Economic Council (NEC); Congressional Caucus on AI; and Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism (CTEC), where I today serve as Senior Advisor for Machine Learning in Counterintelligence.

Formerly, I served as founding CTO of JPMorgan In–Residence business Volley ML, saving Fortune 100 firms millions in real labor annually with the first autonomous Natural Language Generation (NLG) platform for highly regulated industries (HIG). We designed, engineered, and commercialized Volley’s GPT-like platform for knowledge management use cases with a world-class team from Google, the NSA & CIA, Stanford, and the Fortune 500—with backing from JPMorgan, Silicon Valley Bank, Goldman Sachs leaders, and Zuckerberg—before I was recruited to lead & restructure Brainspace AI ahead of its acquisition. Formerly, on the heels of a stint at Google (via the ATLAS Institute), I spanned product functions & technical marketing on the Founding Team at Vetica.com (acquired – now one of the top 3 learning analytics platforms in North America).

I invest through Thiel-backed VC firm SI Capital, The Enterprise AI Fund, and Transpire Ventures.

deepsense.ai,Piotr Niedzwiedz,"CEO/CTO & founder of neptune.ai | Talking about internal ML platforms, MLOps and LLMOps",https://pl.linkedin.com/in/piotrniedzwiedz,"Warsaw, Mazowieckie, Poland","Hey, I am Piotr, and I am the CEO of neptune.ai. 

Day to day, apart from running the company, I focus on the product side of things. Strategy, planning, ideation, getting deep into user needs and use cases. I really like it.

My path to ML started with software engineering. 

Always liked math and started programming when I was 7. In high school, I got into algorithmics and programming competitions and loved competing with the best. 

That got me into the best CS and Maths program in Poland, which, funny enough, today specializes in machine learning.

Did internships at Facebook and Google and was offered to stay in the Valley. But something about being a FAANG engineer didn’t feel right. I had this spark to do more. Build something myself.

So with a few of my friends from the algo days, we started Codilime, a software consultancy, and later a sister company, Deepsense.ai machine learning consultancy, where I was a CTO. 

When I came to the ML space from software engineering, I was surprised by the messy experimentation practices, lack of control over model building, and a missing ecosystem of tools to help people deliver models confidently.  

It was a stark contrast to the software development ecosystem, where you have mature tools for DevOps, observability, or orchestration to execute efficiently in production.

And then, one day, some ML engineers from Deepsense.ai came to me and showed me this tool for tracking experiments they built during a Kaggle competition (which we won btw). 

And I knew this could be big. 

Asked around, and everyone was struggling with managing experiments. I decided to spin it off as a VC-funded product company, and the rest is history.",35,,CEO/CTO & Founder ,"Neptune Labs, Inc.", Co-founder & CTO,deepsense.ai, Co-founder & CTO,CodiLime - Creating Value,University of Warsaw,"Master of Science (MS), Computer Science",University of Warsaw,Mathematics,Python,Algorithms,Linux,Programming,C++,3,,"CEO and founder of neptune.ai, a leading big data analytics workbench for data scientists; Former co-founder and CTO of deepsense.ai, a machine learning consultancy; Featured in interviews and blogs discussing MLOps trends and machine learning experimentation practices",4,7.0,positive,,,,,L4,"Piotr Niedzwiedz demonstrates a strong technical background and proven entrepreneurial track record.

I understand all the demands facing small business owners, namely because I have been one myself for the past 20 years. Unfortunately, we often choose to overlook the essentials of building a healthy business presence online because, it feels too overwhelming with all the different experts and gurus out there today. Overwhelming is an understatement. I'm sure you are very gifted at your chosen profession and you are passionate about what you do. I have witnessed first hand the stress and frustration of business owners that just aren't online marketing experts, and that's OK, you just need to be able to focus on your core business and allow someone to help. That's one reason why I LOVE what I do because I provide solutions that work and I remove the burden from you at a price that won't require a SBA Loan. 

It's going to be alright, I'm here to help! 

Here are some thoughts that you should consider as 4 key indicators that we need to have a chat (sooner than later):
✔ Has the National Weather Service given your website a first name. (You know like a hurricane, not because its powerful but it looks like the aftermath)
✔ Your Facebook page has less engagement than the latest Backstreet Boys album. 
✔ The last time you got an online lead was just after Al Gore invented the internet ;) (seriously)
✔ The dictator of North Korea has a better online reputation than you do...

I can help your business solve these problems!

✔ Simple, clean, secure, mobile friendly website design that will make your competition look, well, not so competitive! 
✔ Facebook programs that will cause your customers to become your source of limitless reach and engagement!
✔ New leads and more repeat business!
✔ Improved customer experience to boost your reputation!

Gimme,Evan Jarecki,Helping unattended retail & DSD operators achieve excellence.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanjarecki,Atlanta Metropolitan Area,"As Co-Founder and CEO of Gimme, I’ve dedicated my career to helping unattended retail operators achieve operational excellence. Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of leading dozens of in-person Go-Lives for Gimme’s innovative solutions. Whether riding alongside route drivers or working shoulder-to-shoulder with warehouse supervisors, I’ve always believed in a “show, don’t tell” approach—ensuring every customer has the tools and support they need to succeed.

My hands-on experience in the field has shaped Gimme’s focus on empathy, problem-solving, and gumption. These values have guided every major product launch at Gimme, and I personally led the initial implementations to guarantee an exceptional experience for our first customers. This commitment hasn’t gone unnoticed; I’ve been honored as one of Automatic Merchandiser’s Pros to Know in 2017, 2019, 2021, and 2022.

Beyond the field, I’ve enjoyed spearheading marketing projects and fostering a positive, collaborative team culture at Gimme. It’s rewarding to see these efforts inspire both customers and colleagues, driving innovation in the unattended retail industry. I’m equally passionate about supporting other entrepreneurs, contributing to Atlanta’s vibrant startup ecosystem through initiatives like Startup Atlanta and Georgia Tech’s Create-X program. Watching other founders grow reminds me of the journey Gimme has taken and the potential our industry has to keep evolving.

At the heart of my work is a vision: to make unattended retail operations more efficient and empowering by embracing tools like AI that automate repetitive tasks and free up operators to focus on what truly matters—their people. Convenience services are a human-driven business, and I’m excited about the role Gimme can play in making it even more impactful.

When I’m not working, I’m at home with my wife and our son, enjoying the adventure of parenthood. I’m also a gamer at heart, diving into virtual worlds whenever I have the chance.

CFO of JACOBI Estate
Investor

Nicolas Jacobi is the CEO of Noble NoBull Productions (Australia) which he co-founded in 2008 and Executive Producer of Jacobi Productions Inc. (Canada) which he co-founded in 2023. With 17 years in the entertainment industry, Nicolas made his mark early as a Record Label Executive and Talent Manager before shifting gears into film producing—where he’s carving out a reputation for bold, genre-bending storytelling with commercial bite.

Born on the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia but based in Vancouver, BC Nicolas lives and breathes creative execution. His career spans A&R development, music publishing, talent management, music video production, and global marketing—he’s basically done everything short of running craft services.

Having already developed three films and assisted in their sales, he’s currently producing a darkly witty comedy-thriller PARLOUR inspired by Mary Howitt’s classic poem The Spider and the Fly, as well as an intellectual spy thriller OPERATION DOMINO based on the true-life experience of a former intelligence agent's case—whose life rights he owns.

Nicolas was set to produce his first feature back in 2016, an ambitious Australia/UK co-production with eOne attached and interest from Tom Hardy’s manager for the lead role. But timing is everything—he was deep into A&R development with A&R Worldwide, working alongside tastemaker Sat Bisla (who helped launch the careers of Katy Perry, Adele, and Bonnie McKee). He chose to double down on his music talent roster in Los Angeles.
Fast forward: Now Jacobi doesn’t just develop stories—he builds movements.

Strongest AI,Matthew Russell,Fitness Tech. First Principles. Apocalyptic Protocols. ⚔️ Amor Fati,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ptwobrussell,"Franklin, Tennessee, United States","Re: ""Apocalyptic Protocols""

The ultimate apocalyptic protocol is being the captain of your own soul. Being prepared for the unknown -- and the unknowable. Working your personal problems down to the mat and embracing the grind. Understanding that the only easy day was yesterday. Memento Mori.

===

Out of the night that covers me,
      Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
      For my unconquerable soul.

In the fell clutch of circumstance
      I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
      My head is bloody, but unbowed.

Beyond this place of wrath and tears
      Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
      Finds and shall find me unafraid.

It matters not how strait the gate,
      How charged with punishments the scroll,
I am the master of my fate,
      I am the captain of my soul.

Martin served as CEO of ApplyBoard from 2015 to 2022. Under his leadership ApplyBoard grew to a team of 1500+ assisting more than 1M students with their study abroad journey from more than 130 countries. During this time ApplyBoard partnered with over 1,600+ schools across Canada, US, UK, Australia and Ireland. ApplyBoard was named the fastest growing tech company in Canada and became globally recognized with a valuation of over $3B, and attracting $500 million in investments. 

At ApplyBoard, Martin noticed a limitation. There were many deserving students who he wished to help who did not have the financial means to do so. Driven by his commitment and passion for the mission of “educating the world”, he started Passage in 2023. Passage’s goal is to provide financial access for deserving individuals that - through no fault of their own - grew up without the means to fulfill their potential. Continuing and augmenting his work at ApplyBoard as a board member, Martin now is building the financial infrastructure for smart immigration so that anyone with the drive and aspiration can radically change their lives through social mobility.",37,,Founder & CEO,Passage,ApplyBoard,10 yrs 7 mos,Bendix Commercial Vehicle Systems LLC,1 yr 7 mos,University of Waterloo,"Master’s Degree, MME, Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering",Shiraz University,"Bachelor’s Degree, EE, Electrical and Electronics Engineering",Leadership,Public Speaking,Simulink,Entrepreneurship,Lean Startup,5,Innovators of Color 2023 - ASU+GSV Summit,Speaker at ASU GSV Summit; Co-Founder/Producer at SAAS NORTH Conference,,7.0,positive,,,,Built ApplyBoard into a $4B unicorn with $100M+ ARR,L8,"Martin Basiri qualifies as a proven unicorn builder based on his exceptional track record with ApplyBoard.

Starting out at a global hedge fund, I quickly realized that what I loved most was interacting with people and helping them solve problems - and this has shaped my journey ever since. 

On joining Sailthru, a fast-growing startup, I got the chance to help businesses of all sizes leverage big data to grow and personalize their reach. 

Heading their UK and EMEA operations fueled my entrepreneurial side - setting up a new London office and working with clients from across countries and cultures. It was a thrill to be part of Sailthru’s success story and witness a team of 40 grow to 200 within a year. 

By now, I knew I wanted to build my own venture from the ground up - one that is truly inclusive and empowers people to make a meaningful impact.

And a fateful meeting with a friend brought it all together as Oden Technologies. 

We got to work right away - meeting with manufacturers in boardrooms and on the factory floor to learn on-the-ground realities (4 am every day!), as well as working with some of the brightest investors and engineers in the global tech community. 

What we learned helped us to build a technology that truly enables manufacturers and the plant floor workforce to spend less time fire-fighting and more time making better decisions faster and creating a bigger impact for their company. 

It’s a pursuit that I am grateful to be on and humbled every day by the people I get to share it with.

When I’m not at work you’ll find me chasing my kids, running marathons, or reading about business, politics, and science fiction.

Twenty-five years, 20+ ventures, and two exits later, I’m still chasing the same idea: technology that multiplies human potential and channels profit into positive impact.

Now
I’m the founder of Adora AI, an AI-OS and security suite designed for organizations that won’t compromise on data sovereignty or speed. We blend multi-model orchestration, symbolic-entropy encryption, and agentic workflows to give enterprises super-powers without handing their IP to a single vendor. A thousand+ companies have already staked a spot for our September 2025 launch.

What drives my obsession?

Frontier AI design — marrying UX clarity with model-level innovation
Privacy-by-design security — patenting on-device, NFC/NFMI-ready next-gen encryption
Brand-first growth — story-driven demand gen that doubles qualified leads
Regenerative impact — using Adora to Do Good in the world

How I got here

Marketing mad scientist since age 13, an Eagle Scout, and yes— even a survivor of an 86-foot rock-climbing fall all taught me urgency, resilience, and empathy in equal measure. I’ve operated everywhere from bootstrapped scrums to PE-backed scale-ups, raising capital, shipping product, and mentoring founders along the way.

Thesis
Great tech should narrow divides, not widen them. Bring Humans closer to humanity, not further away, and ultimately Do Good in the world. My north star is building systems that reward generosity, protect privacy, and invite everyone to the table.

Although there are some many to choose from, through different jobs, studies, and activities I was able to truly feel like opening my own company is my path. It’s a challenging topic in which I enjoy learning and applying day in and day our. Running my own business will enable me to apply my passion to work with clients. My long-term goal is to own multiple retail stores and tune Arabella into it's own brand.

Most importantly, however, my success derives from building a lasting trust with my clients. As such, my solid marketing and interpersonal skills have enabled me to consistently exceed my daily sales goal over the last three years. I excel both independently and in teams. Aside from my current job, I plan charitable events. In August 2014, I put together a Banquet for ‘Human Concern International’ and raised a little over $3,000 and in November 2014, I put together a bake sale and raised around $800 for the ‘Quebec Breast Cancer Foundation.’ As such, my solid marketing, time management, and interpersonal skills have enabled me to consistently exceed my short-term goals over the last three years.

⭐Building Team Capability ⭐

At People HQ we have been supporting our clients with a number of effective solutions when it comes to building capability.

We get it, it is common for colleagues to get promoted into supervisory or management roles because they have been process experts, however, they don’t always get the tools to effectively manage their teams.  

To help close the gap we offer a 5 module development programme that is designed to provide supervisors and managers with the tools needed to effectively manage teams. 

People HQ’s 5 module ‘Team Capability’ programme – modules include:

All modules are delivered with a splash of fun and with the principle of experiential learning at the fore.
