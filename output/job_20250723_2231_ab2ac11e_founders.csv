Quick summaries of the five W’s – WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY – intended to provide highlights of my story and catalyze more meaningful connections, dialogues, and opportunities for impact.

WHO: I am a husband, father, friend, founder, executive, entrepreneur, public speaker, scientist, inventor, advanced technology developer, advisor, consultant, teacher, mentor, non-profit board member, volunteer, handyman, helper, trivia nut, nerd, game player, nature lover, traveler.

WHAT: Simply put - I build. Vocationally, I have founded and led biotechnology development programs and companies that harnessed science and technology in new ways to build knowledge, technologies, products, and systems. So far these have enhanced national security, healthcare, and wellness.  To do this successfully I have had to learn to build up people, relationships, teams, visions, cultures, missions, knowledge, creativity, perspective, empathy, character, patience, and persistence/endurance. 

WHEN: I have been drawn to science and technology for as long as I can remember. I grew into a scientist while pursuing my PhD and have been building knowledge in a number of disciplines since the early 1990’s.  I began working as a technology developer and systems thinker/engineer early in my career at MIT Lincoln Laboratory and began leading and managing projects and teams in the early 2000’s. I have been building skills and experience as an entrepreneur and executive since I founded Sonde Health in 2015.

WHERE: I was born in Australia, raised in Missouri and Georgia, and have studied, worked, and lived in Boston for all my adult life. I have spent time in 19 countries so far. In chronological order these are: Australia, USA, USSR, Finland, Denmark, Sweden, Great Britain, Ireland, Mexico, Netherlands, Canada, Vietnam, Thailand, Japan, Azores/Portugal, Aruba, India, Germany, and Norway.
