The building blocks of all businesses are people. With the wrong people, all businesses eventually die

With the right people businesses thrive

Think about Tesla, Google, Microsoft etc... then think about the talent they hire

The boardroom is often looking at the quality of their leaders

But are their leaders continuously looking at the quality of their people?

Are the leaders (you) aware of how critical the skill of hiring is to contributing to the businesses success

Even to your personal career success?

If today you're spending more money than you initially hoped on hiring

If hiring is taking longer than you'd like

And if sometimes you realise you've had to settle for a below-standard hire in some regard

That can all change

Consistently hiring people inside of budget, inside of timescales, and to your original expectations happens with the right hiring strategy & systems

I am a product of the relationships I built and opportunities I was handed. In the process I built a deep skill stack around fusing business & technology, forging deep relationships & building/scaling high output organizations. 

We are building the most ambitious project of my lifetime—Autonomize AI. Healthcare has no shortage of data. What it lacks is context, actionability, and velocity. Despite a decade of digitization, we’re still struggling to translate information into faster access, affordable care, and radically improved outcomes.

That’s the gap we’re closing. Not with dashboards or more portals—but with compound AI agents that reason, learn, and act across workflows.

We’re not just automating. We’re Autonomizing healthcare.

👉🏽 Autonomizing clinical development by turning slow, static trial operations into dynamic, intelligent workflows that adapt in real time—accelerating drug development at scale.

👉🏽 Delivering precision care by unlocking patient insights from charts, claims, and labs—across silos, across formats—so care teams can personalize decisions, not guess.

👉🏽 Augmenting healthcare professionals with copilots that surface the signal in the noise—enabling smarter, faster, more confident decisions at every step.

👉🏽 Building the world’s healthcare knowledge graph—a living network of context-rich, computable insights that power better decisions across the care continuum.

👉🏽 Equipping every knowledge worker with their own Ironman suit—a personal AI assistant that amplifies their intelligence and reduces their burden, every day.

This is Autonomize AI. A future where every healthcare decision is intelligent, timely, and impactful.
