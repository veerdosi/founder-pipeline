2001-07: I worked at Apple for eight years. I became one of the early key members of Apple's Secret Products working on the first iPhone. After architecting and building their internal enterprise platforms and security applications, I moved into the consumer product area and led software development teams at Apple's Secret Product (NPI) group for a few years. My team worked on the first iPhone's security and provisioning system that outlasted device unlock attacks.

2007-11: After Apple, I was the Founder & President of Avot Media, enabling streaming video into a wide variety of mobile smartphones and tablets. We grew revenue locally & internationally and sold that startup to Smith Micro, a public company in Orange County.

2011-13: Post Avot, because of my passion for startups, I joined Turner Broadcasting and helped start Media Camp. During this time, we engaged on the business side and made 13 seed investments into media startups. Two of them exited shortly post-investment.

The primary focus of my career has been the founding and building of Recursion, a digital biology company industrializing drug discovery and beyond. Recursion combines automation, artificial intelligence, biology and chemistry with a highly cross-functional team to discover medicines that will change the lives of patients and their families. Over time, as our rich, relatable and proprietary database of petabytes of biological data has grown, we are increasingly moving from an unbiased brute-force search to an autonomous prediction, learning and inference system. The result will turn drug discovery into a many-parameter optimization problem, shift failure earlier in the process and allow for massive parralellization.

Kontakt.io,Rafał Janicki,FOUNDER of Kult.io 🔵 AWS Architecture & DevOps | AI Workflow Automation 🔵 Optimize cloud costs 🔵 I will build AI solutions that will realistically automate your business 🔵 Let's jump on a call!,https://pl.linkedin.com/in/rafaljanicki,"Cracow, Małopolskie, Poland","I help companies reduce cloud costs, automate business processes using AI, and build reliable DevOps environments that simply work and grow with the business.

As an engineer, I have spent years designing and optimizing AWS architectures, automating business processes (DevOps & CI/CD), and deploying custom AI agents that take over repetitive tasks and save real time for teams.

I don't implement technology for technology's sake. I understand the business from the inside out, as I've built and sold startups myself and run my own technology company for years. As a result, I quickly identify real problems in companies and adapt solutions to support growth rather than generate chaos.

How can I help you?
🔵 Optimizing AWS costs without compromising on stability and scalability.
🔵 Designing and implementing DevOps infrastructure and processes from scratch so your business can grow without technology debt.
🔵 Automating business processes using AI - from automating workflows, to AI agents supporting the operations team, to automating reporting and analysis.
🔵 Building custom AI agents fully tailored to your business, replacing repetitive processes and allowing people to focus on valuable work.

I believe AI automation is the next step after the cloud revolution and an opportunity for your business to gain an edge by freeing up people's time for development and sales rather than manual processes.

Want to reduce cloud costs, automate repetitive processes or prepare your company for the AI era? Get back to me - I'll show you how we can do it in a way that is practical and tailored to your company's real needs.

CytoVale,Ajay Shah,CEO & Co-Founder at Cytovale | Pioneering Early Detection by Revealing the Biology of Sepsis | Expert in Cell-Based Imaging & Machine Learning | Driving FDA-Cleared Solutions to Save Lives,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajaymukeshshah,"San Francisco, California, United States","I’ve always been fascinated by the intersection of urgency and innovation. The human body, when under threat, whispers signals of distress—but too often, we fail to hear them in time. My career has been a journey to change that narrative. As the co-founder and CEO of Cytovale, I lead a team dedicated to one mission: empowering clinicians to diagnose sepsis in the critical moments when lives hang in the balance. At Cytovale, we’ve developed IntelliSep, a groundbreaking diagnostic tool that can identify sepsis in as little as 10 minutes. When every second matters, that’s the difference between a life saved and a life lost. This work didn’t start with Cytovale—it’s the product of a career steeped in exploration, problem-solving, and an unyielding belief in the potential of science to transform healthcare. At the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, I had the privilege of developing a platform for isolating circulating tumor cells under the mentorship of two giants in the field, Mehmet Toner and Daniel Haber. That experience wasn’t just about lab work; it was a masterclass in what happens when innovation meets collaboration. Before Cytovale, I co-founded two life sciences companies, one of which was acquired in 2012. Those experiences taught me the delicate art of translating complex science into tangible solutions that not only work but also resonate with investors, clinicians, and patients. What drives me now is the same question that drove me then: How can we use technology to solve the problems that matter most? For me, it’s about more than engineering solutions; it’s about listening to the clinicians on the frontlines and partnering with investors who believe in the vision as much as the metrics. It’s about being agile enough to seize the unexpected opportunities that come your way but grounded enough to value the trusted advice of those who’ve walked this road before. Today, Cytovale isn’t just an idea—it’s a reality with FDA-approved technology, paying customers, and a growing impact. But for me, it’s just the beginning. Because innovation isn’t a destination—it’s a mindset. And when you get it right, it’s nothing short of revolutionary. Want to know more about what drives me and the work we’re doing at Cytovale? Check out this interview.

At the same time, Inkitt’s algorithm analyzes reader engagement with every story to predict each novel’s potential for mainstream success. 

By eliminating subjectivity from the publishing process, Inkitt is able to identify top-selling content that may have otherwise been passed on or never discovered due to publishers’ personal opinions or aspiring authors’ inaccessibility to writing and publishing means.

I lead Slang's technical efforts as co-founder and CTO.

☞ Software development
I've got extensive experience in many modern software-development ecosystems, including web (on the front end: the usual languages plus TypeScript, Elm, Reason, usually on React; on the back end: Ruby, Python, Go, etc.) and mobile (both hybrid with React Native and Flutter and native with Swift and Kotlin). I've also got a lot of experience — non-professional, albeit — with some more niche languages like Prolog and Haskell. I am very comfortable with database management, infrastructure maintenance, and most other corners of dev-ops.

☞ Artificial intelligence and machine learning
My machine-learning background is rooted in computer vision, but the ML research I lead today is focused on natural-language processing, particularly in domain-specific ASR, WSD, and MT. My academic background is in theoretical computer science (specifically, computability and complexity theory) and mathematics.

☞ Design
I at least like to think I have a good eye for design. I'm very comfortable with product design/management, UX optimization, branding, typography/typesetting, and print design. I'm honing my illustration chops. (I've got a bunch of experience with video post-production, too, for the rare-but-fun occasion that comes up.)

☞ Management

9 HARD TO BELIEVE YET TRUE STORIES:

1. (1985) From Rejection to Recognition: He didn't get into IIT, but by 2008, he was the keynote speaker at IIT Delhi and spoke at multiple events.

2. (1988) Under the Radar, Until He Wasn't: In school, he was never among the top 3 students in his class of 40. Yet, in 1988, he earned a National Scholarship from the Government of India for securing 2nd position at University level in Mathematical Statistics.

3. (1995) Tech Leader & DJ: In California, he balanced his tech career with his passion for music, co-hosting DJ events on weekends.

4. (1999) Closer to Home: Returned to India on 30-Dec-99 to help set up company's outsourcing center. Later surrendered Green Card in 2005.

5. (2004) No Harvard degree but did a 2-year project working with senior management folks at Harvard University.

6. (2007) Humble Beginnings to Corporate Heights: Around 1980, he rented a bicycle for just Rupee 1 ($0.1). Fast forward to 2007, while battling a brief but life-threatening illness in hospital, he received a call from an executive search firm representing Google, offering him the position to head Google's Gurgaon office / India's core operations.

7. (2009) Diverse Experience, Global Impact: After Lehman Brothers crash, Google paused its India expansion, leading him and other leaders to leave. Following stints in California, Bangalore, Hyderabad, he became an entrepreneur & launched a B2C venture in Delhi. Though it didn't sustain, it provided invaluable lessons. He later teamed up with his son to grow AMBER, an innovative Enterprise SaaS HR product. 

8. (2018) Life Motto: Despite losing his 18-year son to cancer in 2018 and facing near bankruptcy in 2019, he believes life has its highs & lows, but persistence and continuous learning ensure the universe has something positive in store.

9. (2025) Over last 10 years, this Father-Son startup duo, together with Varun Puri & a team of 120, has expanded their customer base to over 300 globally. 

As a leader, he helps corporate employees feel heard while providing CXOs valuable analytical insights on what's working well and areas needing improvement.

OPEN TO CONNECTIONS: 
Instead of Insta/FB, he prefers meeting people F2F to exchange stories. If you want to discuss gauging employee sentiment using AI, scaling a startup 10x with OKRs and consulting rigour, or simply enjoy a fun chat over tea, he's all ears, loves wearing a smile.

At HOLLER AI, we deliver HOLLER OS, a hybrid CRM platform seamlessly integrated with AI-powered Voice and Chat Assistants. Designed to replace multiple apps, HOLLER OS streamlines operations, saves money on subscription fees, and eliminates the frustration of setting it all up yourself. We don’t just give you a login and a few videos—we build it for you, so you can focus on growing your business.

I founded HOLLER OS after spending over 30 years running companies and using tools like HubSpot, NetSuite, Salesforce, and Zoho CRM. Time and again, I found these platforms to be overly complex, difficult to implement, and full of shortcomings that didn’t align with real-world business needs. With HOLLER AI, we’ve created a solution that works for you, not the other way around.

In addition to HOLLER AI, I’ve built and sold multiple WISPs (Wireless Internet Service Providers) and founded RFworx over 13 years ago. RFworx has been instrumental in deploying advanced wireless and fiber technologies, delivering high-capacity, low-latency internet connections for businesses. We’ve had the privilege of building systems for some of the largest private venues in the U.S., including Walt Disney World in Orlando and all eight MGM Casinos in Las Vegas.

Having gone from whiteboards and duct tape to venture-backed growth, to products in operation with meaningful customers, to a public company, BG was acquired by SoftBank in 2023. As of this writing, BG holds more than 400 patents and the last publicly articulated revenue expectations were ~$100M in topline revenue. Today, BG is continuing its positive trajectory with announced special partnership(s), a few thoughtfully aligned lines of business serving material customers, and a seasoned management team of proverbial varsity players.

Prior to BG, Wagner served as Chief Technology Officer at iRobot, which at the time was a global leader in consumer robotics and robots for defense, industrial applications, and telepresence. Earlier in his career, he served as a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), the technology agency of the U.S. Department of Defense, where he created and managed programs in artificial intelligence, robotics, communications, command and control, telehealth, connected devices, agent-based systems, and intelligent assistants.  Several of these programs and technologies transitioned to use and/or helped spawn commercially-focused companies and products. 

Before DARPA, Wagner served as a principal lead at Honeywell, a professor at the University of Maine, and held leadership and advisory roles in small and startup companies. His early experiences includes work at General Motors and various and sundry places and functions—from databases to manufacturing backpacks to establishing & managing a retail store to pumping gas.

He holds a Ph.D. in computer science and artificial intelligence from the University of Massachusetts Amherst, an M.S. in computer science from University of New Hampshire, and a B.S. in computer science from Michigan State.

Throughout my career, I’ve been fortunate to lead from the frontlines of innovation — from launching startups to scaling global AI programs. I previously served as Global Chief Data and AI Officer at Tecnotree, driving adoption of cutting-edge data and AI technologies for telecom and healthcare clients around the world. Prior to that, I was the Co-Founder and CTO of CognitiveScale, where I helped build the world's 4th largest AI patent portfolio and led development of the award-winning Cortex platform, delivering trusted AI to clients in financial services, healthcare, and digital commerce.

My journey at IBM began in 2006 as part of the Webify acquisition, where I served as Lead Architect and Senior Technical Staff Member, helping shape IBM’s Business Process Management and Service-Oriented Architecture product portfolios. In 2011, I helped launch the IBM Watson Group and led Watson Labs, driving the creation of early AI-powered products and solutions.

I’m also proud to serve as Vice Chairman of the Responsible AI Institute, where we focus on advancing human-centric, transparent, and ethical AI.

In his career in Silicon Valley, Dilawar led and scaled ventures in AI, software, and consumer web. 

Dilawar’s most recent role as SBA Deputy Administrator began with a bipartisan vote of the U.S. Senate. Dilawar advanced the Biden Administration's priorities for small businesses by democratizing access to capital, government contracting, and entrepreneurship enablement, especially in the underserved and rural communities. He helped coordinate SBA’s disaster response after Hurricanes Helene and Milton in the Southeast, the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapse in Baltimore, MD, and the wildfires in Maui, HI.

As Special Envoy for Commercial Affairs at the Department of State, Dilawar served as America’s top commercial diplomat, championing U.S. companies in markets abroad. He mobilized private sector support for Ukraine after Russia's invasion, advocated for strategic deals in advanced tech, energy, aviation, and defense, and negotiated market access in his 24 bilateral engagements across the globe.

Dilawar has previously served as CEO of Lumiata, an AI healthcare company backed by Khosla Ventures and BlueCross BlueShields, and as President at Freshworks, where he founded the software company's North America business (IPO in 2021). Earlier, he held product leadership roles at Yahoo! and Siebel Systems.

In a world where supply chains power everything, I make it my mission to provide shippers with dynamic, reliable solutions – and most importantly, peace of mind.

The logistics industry is massive, but it’s also plagued with inefficiencies – from late deliveries and limited transparency to compliance challenges, outdated tech, and even fraud. I’ve seen these gaps firsthand, especially in the critical middle-mile segment for temperature-controlled shipments. That’s where I chose to make a difference.

I founded Roadly Logistics with a clear mission: deliver trust, transparency, and unmatched service in middle-mile freight. We’ve grown rapidly by focusing on customer needs, leveraging technology, and building a team of top talent. Today, we’re proud to be a trusted partner for shippers across the country.

My passion goes beyond solving logistics problems. It’s about building teams, developing a winning culture, and empowering people to do their best work. As we continue to expand, I stay focused on resource planning, strategic growth, and ensuring that Roadly remains a leader in our space.

| Education Revolutionist | Social Impact Architect | 

From Cambodian Jungles to Global Change: A Life Built on Purpose

Teacher Raj Ridvan Singh is not only an award-winning social entrepreneur — he is a living embodiment of the fight against poverty and inequality. His journey began in the harsh realities of early-2000s Cambodia, co-founding his first NGO at the age of 17 with nothing but determination and less than USD 1 in his pocket, 25 years ago. Amidst war-torn landscapes, he built community centres from scratch, taught tens of thousands of youth, and experienced firsthand the dignity and pain of poverty.

These formative years shaped not only his mission but his unshakeable conviction: poverty is not just a statistic, it has a face, a family, and a future that can be changed.

Today, Teacher Raj is the visionary founder and CEO of SOLS 24/7, a globally recognized social enterprise ecosystem transforming education, renewable energy, mental health, and technology inclusion for underserved communities across Southeast Asia. www.sols247.com

Impact at Scale:

Over 850,000 students directly empowered

More than 3 million lives impacted across 6 countries

Raised over RM 80 million for poverty alleviation and sustainable development

Malaysia’s No.1 Home Solar company, helping Malaysians save RM 30M+ annually

Petronas & 500 Startups-backed

His ventures include:

SOLS Foundation — 25 years of free education, life skills and Energy access solutions for the poor

SOLS Energy — 28MW of clean energy solutions 

ChargeSingh — affordable EV infrastructure for home users

SOLS Edu — mobile-first English learning platform with over 48,000 users

SOLS Smart — Government and corporate training in English, Digital and AI skills

Social Empresa — advancing green entrepreneurship and sustainable business solutions

Philosophy & Legacy
Teacher Raj has redefined what it means to be a social entrepreneur: blending profitability with purpose, success with service. He proves that impact work does not mean sacrifice of ambition — rather, it amplifies it. From hand-building schools in Cambodian jungles to now leading multi-million dollar ventures, he lives by the belief:

“Service and education are not just acts of charity — they are the blueprint for a life well-lived.”

He continues to mentor a new generation of changemakers, showing by example that you can fight poverty, build prosperity, and still live in the home of your dreams — because success with purpose changes the world.",45,,Founder & CEO,SOLS Life · Full-time,Founder - CEO,SOLS 24/7 · Full-time,Founder & CEO,SOLS Foundation,Ford Fellows,Organizational Leadership,New Horizons,"Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer +Internet, Computer Networking, Servers and Systems",Renewable Energy,energy access,Lean Manufacturing,Supply Chain Management,Social Impact,5,Best Sustainability Leader award (2018); Ford Fellows (2015),,,6.0,positive,,,,Pioneered home solar subscription model in Malaysia; Led early adoption of solar loans for residential installations in Malaysia,L6,"Raj Ridvan Singh demonstrates characteristics of a Market Innovator and Thought Leader (L6) through his 25-year track record of creating and scaling multiple social enterprises with significant measurable impact.

That’s why, in 2015, following my service in the White House as Deputy Assistant to the President for Economic Policy and Deputy Director of the National Economic Council, I was inspired to launch Opportunity@Work. 

Our work rises above politics. I have yet to meet a mayor or governor (of either party) who doesn’t want to bring more good jobs to her or his communities. And in every region of the country, I hear the same thing from business (“we can’t find the skills we need”) and from hard working people struggling to break into better paying jobs (“I know what I can do, but no one will give me a chance”).  

Re-wiring the U.S labor market to end this damaging market failure is my mission today, and every day, as the Opportunity@Work team, our outstanding partners, and I work to rewire the U.S. labor market so that all individuals Skilled Through Alternative Routes (STARs) can work, learn, and earn to their full potential.

My life’s mission is to bring human-level AI to the world to optimize human flourishing.   

This, the Holy grail of AI, will significantly lower the costs for many products and services; providing PhD-level AI researchers to help us solve problems like disease, energy, and pollution; and help individuals via expert personal assistants that will enhance productivity, problem-solving ability, and their overall well-being.  

I’ve been dedicated to this mission for more than 20 years. I am now leading a new major initiative to leverage our deep experience and standard-setting commercial Aigo technology to rapidly close the gap to wide-ranging human-level capabilities.  

I can’t think of anything more exciting, or that will have a greater positive impact on humanity.  

Join us in writing the next chapter in the story of human progress. We are actively looking for staff, advisors, collaborators, and investors to accelerate progress.  

Our Technology: The proven path we have taken is very different from the current ‘Big Data’ statistical or generative AI methods currently favored. Our approach implements an Integrated Cognitive Architecture based on a deep understanding of the requirements of human intelligence. It does not suffer the inherent limitations of Big Data methods.   

Our current commercial product based on this technology is called ‘Aigo – Chatbot with a Brain’. Over the past two years we deployed this at enterprise call centers and now have over a million customers with million dollars in ARR by providing highly successful hyper-personalized service to millions of end users. With this we have set a new standard in automation quality and effectiveness.  

My Journey: Started in electronics engineering, launched my first company, then fell in love with software. First major success was developing a comprehensive ERP package and taking that company from Zero to 400-person IPO in seven years.   

Motivated by overcoming the fragile nature of software, I embarked on a 5-year research stint; to deeply understand the nature of intelligence – psychometrics, developmental psychology, epistemology, animal intelligence, and what had been tried and discovered in AI. This research culminated in a new AI theory and the creation of our core AGI technology.  

In 2002 three of us coined the term AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) and published a book. Since then, I have been steadily developing, commercializing, and improving the core technology that will lead us to human-level AI.",65,,Founder/ CEO/ Chief Scientist,Aigo.ai,Founder/ CEO/ Chief Scientist,AGI Innovations Inc,"Founder, CEO, Chief Scientist - Board Member",Smart Action Company LLC,"German School, Johannesburg",,,,Entrepreneurship,Software Development,Start-ups,Management,Project Management,5,,,,8.0,positive,,,,Coined the term Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) in 2001; Developed a comprehensive ERP package leading to a 400-person IPO; Created the world's first intelligent cognitive assistant,L6,"Peter Voss demonstrates characteristics of a Market Innovator and Thought Leader (L6) based on several key factors: 1) He successfully built and IPO'd an ERP company scaling to 400 employees in 7 years, 2) He is recognized as one of the pioneers who coined the term 'AGI' in 2002 and co-authored a book on the subject, 3) His current company Aigo.ai has achieved significant commercial success with 'millions in ARR' and over a million customers, 4) He has demonstrated sustained innovation in the AI field for over 20 years with multiple patents and technological developments.
