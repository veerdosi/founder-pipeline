Runway,Active,Ford Coleman,Founder & CEO of Runway - a hiring platform with vetted early career talent from 150+ universities. Follow for business & career growth insights.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ford-coleman-hirecollegestudents,"Atlanta, Georgia, United States","My mission is to help over 1 million businesses realize the potential of entry level talent and help them hire the right ones for their organization.

Over the last 3 years, I've been working towards accomplishing this goal and built a business that connects companies to university talent for internships/full-time jobs.

Now, a little bit more about my journey...

For the first 25 years of my life I played the game of life - went to a good school growing up, then a great college, and then a kick-ass job at a Fortune 500 company when I graduated.

This game wasn't that much fun to me. It felt like I was rolling 1s and I wanted to be rolling 10s.

So, I decided to pivot from the scripted course and take the plunge into entrepreneurship. I started a company, Runway, which is a marketplace to hire vetted university students and fresh grads for part-time internships, full-time internships, and their first jobs out of school.

We've worked with nearly 300 different companies getting them highly motivated students to do work in business development, software development, and data analytics. We're totally bootstrapped and have only used the cash flows of the business to build it up.

Check us out at www.joinrunway.io!
If you are interested in hiring vetted entry-level talent my email is ford@joinrunway.io.

On Linkedin, I post about how YOU can elevate your career too so follow me if you want to start rolling 10s instead of being okay with rolling 1s.

30 demos of platforms later - it was clear that the answer to that question was broken and filled with expensive old, bloated, disconnected repositories with horrible user experiences across several categories (LMS, CMS, DAP, KMS). 

In 2018 decided to fix it and build Spekit. A Simple yet Spektacular enablement experience that is designed around the END USER experience - meeting them in their flow of work with the knowledge, content and training they need to learn a workflow, master their outreach and close more deals.

Poor data quality leads to hallucinations, security risks, and compliance nightmares. I help solve that.

As Co-Founder & Head of Engineering at Tonic.ai, I lead the development of synthetic data solutions that empower AI and development teams to unlock data safely, efficiently, and at scale.

What I Do:
• Enable AI & ML teams to train models with high-fidelity synthetic data without risking real PII.
• Help developers & test teams create realistic, safe test data that mirrors production without compliance concerns.
• Build unstructured data solutions that improve RAG accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and enhance AI-driven retrieval systems.

My Background:
Since earning my Ph.D. in Physics from Georgia Tech, I’ve spent my career at the intersection of data privacy, AI, and software engineering. I’ve built developer tools, analytics platforms, and AI validation frameworks at companies like:
1. Microsoft & Kabbage – Led UI & feature development, anticipating complex user needs.
2. Tableau – Built analytics and calculation capabilities, driving better data insights.
3. Tonic.ai – Now leading engineering efforts to reshape synthetic data, RAG, and AI validation.

My Passion:
I thrive on solving complex data challenges transforming raw, unstructured enterprise data into high-quality fuel for AI & ML. Whether it’s data privacy, retrieval accuracy, or test data management, I focus on building solutions that make life easier for developers, analysts, and AI teams.

In recent years he has moved back toward the technical world, first as the Director of Pipeline Development for Imaginary Forces, and more recently as a technologist and consultant focusing on creating analog experiences with digital tools. 

From the early days of the experiential marketing explosion he has worked to push the bounds of what is possible in VR and immersive technology with Adam Amaral (Master of Shapes). Using everything from networking to robotics and computer vision to LIDAR mapping they drove cars at high speeds while wearing an HMD in the Castrol Virtual Racers series, brought stereo live action footage into volumetric games with Orange Sunshine: Origins, turned a punching bag into a game controller with Mayweather Punchout, and partnered with HTC VIVE to bring local multiplayer capabilities to VR gaming with Mobile Room-scale as they continued to explore virtual and augmented realities. 

In 2018, Glenn and his partners, Dan Robinson, Nick Bicanic, and Adam Amaral, came together to form Red 6 Aerospace with the goal of bringing augmented reality training into the cockpits of our military and commercial pilots. Since the company's formation, Red 6 has successfully demonstrated the ability to fly through an augmented world to the US Military, media, and industry competitors.

Nectir,Active,Kavitta Ghai,CEO at Nectir—we're building the classroom of the future.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kavittaghai,"Los Angeles, California, United States","I believe that our core purpose here on Earth is to learn. No matter how much knowledge you acquire, there's always more to gain. Growing up with learning disabilities made for a rocky relationship with that realization at first, but now it's the exact reason why I've dedicated my life to building the educational experience that every student and teacher deserves. 

I founded Nectir while I was still a student at UC Santa Barbara after spending my entire freshman year desperately wanting to dropout because I felt confused and invisible in every class. I've always known that our 400-year-old education system needed a serious revamp, but it wasn't until college that I felt the undeniable drive to make that change happen myself. Nectir was born out of my frustration with the education system, coupled with the knowledge that modern tech has the power to solve some of our most pervasive problems (when it's utilized thoughtfully.) Six years later, I'm humbled to have brought together an incredible team of teachers, parents, and fellow students from around the globe to help me build the classroom of the future.

Enterprise mobility was the first wave of digital transformation, which was focused on the front office. Because of the digital transformation of the front office, we have new bottlenecks in the middle and back office. These are the kind of problems I’m working on now.

Looking back, the majority of my career has been spent as an entrepreneur and what has been driving me in that pursuit is the combination of building something from scratch and making a personal impact.

My approach has always been expository. I love to unpick a problem, explore where the paradoxes exist and work with my team to provide a new solution.",61,,CEO and co-founder,Skan.ai,Entrepreneur,Stealth mode startup,CEO and Co-Founder,Endeavour Software Technologies (acquired by Genpact in 2016),"Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur",B.Tech.,"Seth Anand Ram Jaipuria School, Kanpur",,Strategy,Entrepreneurship,Process Intelligence,Leadership,Enterprise Mobility,3,,Featured speaker on AI and process intelligence in insurance technology,,7.0,positive,,,,"Known for starring in Yeh Teri Galiyan and Nath – Zewar Ya Zanjeer; Participated in Bigg Boss 18, finishing in 4th place; Nominated for Indian Television Academy Award for Fan Fiction Jodi (Non-Fiction) in 2025",L4,"Avinash Misra demonstrates characteristics of a Proven Operator (L4) based on two key factors: 1) He successfully founded and exited Endeavour through acquisition by Genpact in 2015, and 2) He's currently leading Skan.ai as CEO/co-founder, which has gained traction in the enterprise process intelligence space.

Magazine’s Female Founders List ‘25",https://www.linkedin.com/in/drartunduaga,San Francisco Bay Area,"I’m a Harvard/UC Berkeley-trained scientist and translational physician who abandoned a surgical career to become a CEO. I did it because of my abuela Sylvia. Growing up, I was close to my grandmother and witnessed her struggle to understand when her COPD was exacerbating. Home lung monitoring technologies are inaccurate or too challenging to use, leaving patients and doctors to rely only on symptoms. As a result, my grandmother died. Her experience with COPD inspired me to found Samay (“to breathe deeply” in Quechua) so that no one else should die because of misdiagnosis.

I love solving complex problems. I excel at applying my analytical skills to find unexpected connections among diverse disciplines. My life exemplifies this: I’m a Colombia Presidential* and National Merit Scholar** (top 0.1%, Valedictorian), started college at 16 and graduated at the top of my class at Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, my country’s #1 medical school. After a 4-year Harvard postdoc and a brief stint in plastic surgery at UChicago, I re-trained in global health and translational medicine at the top three U.S. public schools: U Washington, UC Berkeley, and UCSF. I’ve co-led NIH-Gates-funded projects, published in NEJM, Nature, PNAS, and Genetics in Medicine, received $3 million in awards, raised $2.3M from investors, and was granted an “Extraordinary Abilities” green card just four years after relocating to the US (average is 8+).

Samay combines lung physiology, IoT sensors, signal processing, and AI/ML. My enduring passion for helping others motivates me to embrace any level of complexity. I enjoy questioning in service of my mission, something that practicing clinical medicine didn't encourage. So, I envision Samay as having a culture where people relish problems as gifts of discovery, where fearless nonconformists are driven by social purpose. Someone with my energy level is equipped to market our invention.

I advocate for social justice as I've experienced discrimination in the past. I'm involved in initiatives that support underrepresented minorities in STEM and entrepreneurship. I come from a family of physicians, but I’m married to a Googler engineer and have four balls of joy as pets. At 42, I had my first child after a 4-year-long IVF journey (six retrievals + five transfers). As an immigrant, I know courage and persistence lead to positive outcomes. That’s the core of everything I do.

The Challenges Sales Leaders Face in Senior Living

🚨 Move-ins take too long: Seniors and their families delay decisions, leading to empty rooms and lost revenue.
🚨 Reps miss critical follow-ups: Reps miss key steps, lose track of leads, or fail to engage decision-makers at the right time.
🚨 Referral sources are overlooked: Key influencers like doctors, financial advisors, and community leaders impact move-ins, but reps rarely engage them consistently
🚨 Sales processes are inconsistent: Top reps excel, but others miss opportunities due to lack of guidance.

The best sales leaders don’t just track activity—they coach their teams to take the right actions at the right time. But in a fast-moving sales environment, leaders can’t be everywhere at once.

How We Help

Our AI Agent Budy, is built to learn from your best sales reps and sales leaders—ensuring every rep follows the right process, engages the right people, and moves seniors toward a decision faster.

Your Budy:

✅ Guides sales reps in real time—so they never miss a key step
✅ Helps reps proactively engage influencers in a senior’s decision-making process
✅ Identifies and prioritizes top opportunities based on real-time insights
✅ Ensures every rep benefits from the knowledge of top performers

No new software to learn. Our AI Agent works within your existing CRM and marketing tools, helping sales teams execute at the highest level without changing their workflow.

It’s the only AI Agent built for senior living sales teams. It’s the only one that:

• Has been built from the ground up to understand the differences in how seniors explore Independent Living, Assisted Living, and how families approach Memory Care.
• Guides sales reps through high-touch, relationship-driven sales cycles unique to senior living, ensuring trust is built over time.
• Adapts to the unique challenges and opportunities of each senior living community, ensuring sales teams execute strategies that match their specific market and resident needs.

Celera,Active,Marc Mansfield,"President, Celera Networks Inc.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcmansfield,"Boston, Massachusetts, United States","I’ve been an entrepreneur for as long as I can remember.

I launched my first tech business as a teenager, mostly out of rebellion. I promised myself I'd never spend time doing something I didn’t care about, and to live life on my own terms. I’ve never been one to follow a path I didn’t believe in, and technology has always been where I felt most passionate.

I owe a lot to my parents. They pushed me to go to college—okay, they might’ve kicked me out of the house—but in hindsight, that was one of the best things they ever did for me. I landed at Northeastern University and took full advantage of their co-op program, working in technical roles at top-tier companies like Raytheon and MIT Lincoln Labs. 

That experience gave me the foundation to build something bigger.

A wise man once said, “Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity.” That’s how Celera Networks started: just me, a laptop, and a handful of early clients—some of whom are still with us.

Today, Celera has grown into a thriving team of IT, cybersecurity, and client service professionals who serve hundreds of organizations. The talent, passion, and focus of our team is the reason we continue to evolve and lead in a constantly shifting industry.

Technology never stops moving, and the pace of change can be overwhelming. But my philosophy has always been simple: listen closely to your clients and your team. They’ll tell you what’s coming next—and if you’re paying attention, they’ll show you where to go.

Right now, my focus is on artificial intelligence—first to understand it deeply, and then to lead the charge in helping our clients fully leverage IT to solve real-world business challenges and drive measurable impact.

The next wave of change is here. And Celera Networks is ready to ride it.

My career began as a corporate attorney, focused on M&A, private equity and VC at two multinational firms. I left in 2007 to start an investing company focused on distressed assets and companies. The recession thrust me into technology and the startup world, and led to starting multiple business ventures.

In 2008 I started a payments company that was acquired by ShopKeep, where I served as the Chief Revenue Officer. ShopKeep was later acquired by Lightspeed (NYSE: LSPD).

Currently, at Loris, we provide real-time coaching for customer support agents. When making the transition to chat and email-based support, companies use Loris to help the support team seamlessly move to these more modern mediums of customer conversations.

SoWork,Active,Emma Giles,COO & Co-Founder of SoWork,https://ca.linkedin.com/in/emmakgiles,"Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada","I love diving into messy, complex problems and untangling priorities to make sense of the chaos. Whether it’s creating a plan in the unknown, spotting the one thing—a bottleneck, risk, or opportunity—that will have an outsized impact, or helping a team find clarity, that’s where I thrive. I’m especially good at re-articulating perspectives—helping teams see when they’re actually aligned (but don’t realize it) or pointing out the real differences when they think they’re on the same page. I bring first-principles thinking, clarifying frameworks, a knack for cutting through the noise, and a genuine joy for articulating it all in a way that truly resonates. (If you’re into Working Genius, I’m a Discernment/Galvanizing type—so this is my sweet spot!)

At SoWork, as COO and co-founder, I use these strengths every day to help remote teams do their best work. We’ve built a virtual workspace that makes collaboration easy, sparks creativity, and keeps team culture alive—even when you’re miles apart. It’s not just about getting things done; it’s about helping people and teams thrive together.

Before SoWork, I tackled big challenges in education and research. At Khan Academy, I created free content to help students prep for nursing and medical school entrance exams. Later, I took on a research fellowship at Harvard and joined their computational neuroscience PhD program, exploring the brain’s complexities. These experiences gave me a front-row seat to world-changing ideas and taught me how to break down big, gnarly problems.

Two books I’m using in the wild every day are Navigating Polarities and The Gap and The Gain. They’ve been game-changers for me—helping me shift from black-and-white “OR” thinking to a more expansive “AND” mindset. They remind me to embrace complexity and focus on the progress we’ve made, rather than obsessing over what’s next. It’s a mindset shift that’s shaped both how I work and how I lead.

If you’re into solving tough problems, building for the future, or trading tips on frameworks and ideas, let’s connect.

We're transforming how companies around the world work, by building all-in-one virtual HQs for high-performing remote teams.

I was the top-ranked candidate to take over as the new Director of the MIT Media Lab in 2025. Full story coming soon.

I'm a left-handed ENTJ and hyper-optimist. I am generally 7 minutes late for things (there's a study about this...). I like to build, lead, and work with teams of intelligent and thoughtful people to solve big problems. I like blending hard skills (e.g. programming, data, medicine) with 'soft' skills across the EQ spectrum. Spoiler alert: the 'soft' skills are the most important and are what separates the greats from the rest.

I am the #1 proponent of personal responsibility. At the end of the day - it’s all on YOU. Help from your network, family, government, society are all nice to haves. At the end of the day - only you can get you to where you want to go. 

I also truly do not care about politics, ideology, gender, etc. My friends and colleagues live all flavors of life. Beautiful friendships and shared knowledge can happen between anyone. So let’s be friends.

Critical trivia:

1. I started my first 'company' with my brother when we were 10 and 11. We dumpster-dived for computers, and would refurbish them with pirated software and sell them to buy video games. Chrono Trigger, FF7/8, Breath of the Wild, and the Uncharted series are some of my all-time favs. 

2. Emergency medicine is my super algorithmic hobby that keeps me grounded in 'the real world'. I do this a couple months a year in order to remind myself how fortunate I am to be in startup land instead of full-time medicine (medical culture is terrible - most docs won't admit it out loud).

3. I lived at a 24-hour McDonalds for ~2 weeks during med school when I ran out of money to pay both rent and tuition (I chose to pay tuition 💸).

Kriptos,Active,Christian T.,Boosting DLP/CASB tools to see the invisible 72% (no PII/PCI) | CEO at Kriptos | Full Data Visibility Platform | 1B+ AI-classified docs | 180K+ users,https://www.linkedin.com/in/christian-fernando-torres,"Miami, Florida, United States","The most dangerous data is the one you don't know you have.

After classifying 1 billion+ documents, we discovered: Your security tools are blind to 72% of your sensitive data.

Why? That 72% contains ZERO personal data (PII/PCI). 

Just your:
→ Strategic plans and M&A documents
→ Financial models and pricing strategies
→ Product formulas and technical specs
→ Board minutes and confidential agreements

Regex catches patterns. But it can't understand content and context.

📊 THE HIDDEN TRUTH:
Analyzing 233M documents across 45,000 users revealed 68% of files live on endpoints, not synced to the cloud.

Real examples we've found:
🚨 Reception Desk: 400,000 files, 20% confidential, meters from entrance
🚨 Sales Laptop: 1.2M documents from ERP, entire customer database

❌ WHY TRADITIONAL SECURITY FAILS:
BEFORE protecting information, you NEED to discover and classify what's sensitive.

Ask yourself:
-Does your DSPM scan endpoints and non-PII/PCI data?
-Does your DLP understand business context—or just patterns?
-Does your CASB know content sensitivity—or just track access?

Without classification, you're operating blind.

💡 HOW KRIPTOS CHANGES EVERYTHING:
We don't replace your tools—we give them eyes. Our AI-powered classification enables your DLP/CASB to:

✅ Protect only what truly matters (your 5% crown jewels)
✅ Monitor with context—reducing false positives by 95%
✅ Alert on real risks, not noise

We boost your cybersecurity stack ROI in days, not years.

🏆 THE PROOF:
- 1 billion+ documents classified
- 180,000+ users protected
- 12 countries, 65%+ in financial services
- 15x faster than alternatives

I’m building Kryptos — a financial connectivity protocol layer for Web3.
What started as a solution for crypto taxes has evolved into something much bigger.

Today, we help users and teams with:
	•	Crypto accounting
	•	Treasury tracking
	•	Cross-border payments
	•	Tax reporting in 30+ countries

But at the core, we’re solving a deeper problem: fragmentation.
Too many wallets, chains, exchanges — and no simple way to make sense of it all.

Kryptos is becoming the infrastructure that connects it all.
A protocol where data flows, money moves, and apps (even AI agents) can plug in and act on your behalf — safely and seamlessly.

We believe the future of finance is modular, automated, and borderless.
And we’re building the rails to get us there.

Let’s connect if this resonates — or if you just want to make crypto finance a little less painful.

Hi, Neel here 👋

I've built my career on transforming complex GTM challenges into strategic growth opportunities.

With 20+ years of experience spanning product development, enterprise sales leadership, and entrepreneurship, I've built a multifaceted career. 

My journey began as a developer at Encentuate, which was later acquired by IBM. 

From there, I transitioned into sales leadership roles at IBM, Couchbase, Wavefront (now part of VMware), and Aviatrix, where I honed my skills in driving revenue growth and building high-performing teams. 

These experiences ultimately led me to co-found BoostUp.ai, where I led our go-to-market strategy as CRO, positioning us for growth in the competitive B2B landscape.

Today, I'm leveraging this expertise as Founder of AdamX.ai, where we're revolutionizing the B2B buyer journey through our proprietary Synthetic Buyer technology. 

Our platform enables enterprise organizations to:

→ Become #1 in buyer’s shortlist and achieve 84% win rate
→ Analyze patterns across sales interactions to optimize rep performance
→ Benchmark their buyer experience against competitors with actionable intelligence
→ Identify critical friction points in your marketing and sales which is leading to deal losses

By providing unprecedented visibility into the buyer journey, we help companies maximize their existing investments in content, training, and tools – turning insights into revenue ($$$).

When I’m not immersed in the world of sales, tech and entrepreneurship, you’ll find me on the badminton court, chasing shuttlecocks and staying active. 

I believe in balancing hard work with a bit of fun and fitness – because even the best strategies need a strong mind and body to execute them!

Let’s connect…

If you’re passionate about sales, innovation, and building world-class teams.

I am driven by a mission to transform lives through financial security, preventative healthcare, and the power of a positive mindset. Soon to be the author of ""Positivity Warrior - Strength through Sorrow: How a Positive Outlook can Heal, Inspire, and Change your Life,"" I share my journey of resilience and the transformative impact of positivity in overcoming life’s toughest challenges.

My personal experiences have shaped my career and passions. 
At 18, I lost my father to Huntington’s disease, a devastating illness that later took my sister’s life at 47. My mother, uninsurable for long-term care, endured a four-year struggle with Alzheimer’s, and another sister battled for 10 years after a brain aneurysm left her bedridden. These losses instilled in me an unshakeable commitment to advocating for life insurance, long-term care coverage, and sound retirement   planning.

In addition to my work in financial services, I am dedicated to changing the healthcare system from reactive to preventative. I believe in creating a “healthcare plan” similar to a financial plan—designed to prevent debilitating conditions and save lives before it’s too late.

As a speaker, thought leader, and change agent, I strive to inspire, educate, and innovate. Whether through my writing, professional endeavors, or personal connections, my goal is to help individuals and families achieve security, health, and hope for a brighter future.

I recently left Microsoft to start my 7th startup for enterprise users in the domain of productivity, machine learning and semi-structured data and documents - starting with my deep believe that openness and interoperability raises all boats.

Throughout my entire career, I worked in startups: before Microsoft, with INRIA, the renown French research Labs in 2 of its startups (Gipsi S.A. and Grif S.A.); and within Microsoft creating 4 new startups: XML, InfoPath, opening the Office formats and MS OpenTech. I also recently worked on the Internet of Things.

I still remember the amazed eyes of our customers and to many in the industry when Microsoft led the way with XML, driving the industry to the web services era; when with InfoPath, we created a schematized way for capturing document information for our Office business users and when we opened the Office file formats by XML-izing and standardizing them, ushering a new era of document processing. 

We proudly created MS OpenTech, Microsoft's open source (!!) subsidiary, initiating, at scale, Microsoft Azure’s all-up support for open source and driving today's 40% of Azure usage.

I am the recipient of multiple industry awards for my work on XML, semi-structured data, the convergence of documents and data and openness at large. The startups I built created breakthrough platform technologies used today by millions. 

In addition to core technical design, I take deep care at building healthy ecosystems at worldwide scale. I am one of the key leaders responsible for shifting in a fundamental way, under the guidance of the CEO, Microsoft's strategy to embrace and love open source.

While public’s awareness of the industry has increased significantly, the challenges facing it have never been greater. Personally, I have always been fascinated by new technologies and their potential to increase efficiency, improve safety, and enhance people's lives. The rapid pace of technological advancements in Automation, Robotics, AI, and Machine Learning is truly transformational, and the only limits we face are our own ideas and our willingness to embrace change.

The adoption of new technologies in the Supply Chain Industry will have a dramatic and positive impact on all of us. Automation and Robotics, for instance, have the potential to reduce accidents and prevent injuries, eliminate repetitive and unnecessary tasks, and prevent mistakes while speeding up deliveries. AI and Machine Learning, on the other hand, will enable us to make better decisions, identify inefficiencies, and streamline operations, all of which will ultimately reduce costs.

However, change is never easy and often takes longer than anticipated. As leaders in the industry, we must not only be visionaries and competent individuals but also teachers and motivators with an unwavering passion for making our organizations more agile in adapting to future changes.

Our latest breakthrough: Telematica™, the first platform built for the last mile of automotive telematics. While the industry has focused on generating data, we’re focused on delivering outcomes—activating alerts, booking service, and driving real vehicles into real bays.

We’re not just another software vendor. We’re the Operating System of Customer Engagement for automotive retail—automating scheduling, boosting RO values, optimizing shop capacity, and helping service departments finally tap into the full potential of connected cars.

My focus:
🚀 Scaling SaaS from $5M to $100M+
🔁 Building repeatable R&D + GTM engines that actually work
🧠 Turning AI + telematics into real KPIs—appointments, service revenue, retention, CSI
🛠️ Helping Fixed Ops leaders drive profit, not paperwork
🤝 Partnering with OEMs, dealer groups, and innovators shaping the future

Also: startup mentor, offsite architect, and scoutmaster for a special needs BSA troop—because leadership isn’t just a job, it’s a calling.

In the current role with Twin Health through research on healthcare technology and insight driven decision making skills, formulates strategy towards strengthening the business footprint across the globe. Currently, mitochondrial disorders pose a significant challenge, with no highly effective treatment or cure available. Traditional management relies on supportive therapy, including nutritional management, exercise, and supplements.
At Twin Health, we've pioneered a revolutionary technology - the Whole Body Digital Twin (WBDT). This groundbreaking innovation enables precision treatment recommendations for nutrition, activities, and sleep, allowing us to address disrupted metabolism by fixing the mitochondria.
As a result, chronic metabolic diseases like diabetes, obesity, hypertension, fatty liver, and more are no longer inevitable lifelong conditions. With the WBDT, remission and smart management of these diseases have become a reality, enabling individuals to reduce or eliminate medications and substantially improve their quality of life, free from the fear of complications like heart attacks, strokes, and cancer.
 
Prior to co-founding Twin Health, played an active role in transforming the higher education space in Tamil Nadu, India. Was the President and Chairman of the MAM Group of Institutions in India.

📍Employees, like kids, need to feel calm and safe to do their best work. When employees have a sense that they are in a supportive community, they do the best work of their lives. 
⚡️ Yet, over half of employees with young kids are considering cutting back on their hours or quitting their jobs. 
👧🏼 Why? What is the most important thing in the life of a parent? 
It's their kids. 
And what about kids that are REALLY struggling? What if the kids have serious emotional or behavior problems? 

Maybe their kids have:
Anxiety
ADHD
Mood swings
Autism
Addiction or 
Anger issues

For years I have heard the same refrain from parents, ""where were you 5 years ago?"" ""I have been looking for help for my child since they were little and I never knew where to turn or how to help."" 

We use technology to bring mental health of working parents and caregivers and their children to the forefront. We know that parents who feel ready to take the lead in supporting their child's mental and behavioral health have more success. Their families lead happier lives. At Cadey we don't want location, financial resources or wait times to be a barrier to parents getting the support they need.

I am a child psychologist, and author of a leading autism assessment textbook. My experience spans over two decades as a school psychologist in an urban district, over a decade in clinical practice, and I have been working in the technology start up space for 5 years. As a psychologist in technology my partner and I developed the Cadey app for parents. 

The Cadey app helps working parents, immediately, for free, when they need it. As part of their employer benefits program Cadey is right there, easy to download and login with all kinds of resources at the ready. Video microlearning, courses, assessments, articles, blogs and webinars, Cadey has resources parents need. 

Cadey puts helpful advice and practical strategies for what to say and do at your fingertips, helping parents find and navigate a path to household peace and improved family relationships. 

In addition to being a tech entrepreneur, I have extensive experience conducting comprehensive psychological evaluations, assessment services, training doctoral students, and consulting with families, community providers and schools.

We become our highest or “haute”—selves living not by the standards of others, but by the high standards and values we create for ourselves. I call it the Haute Mindset.

My own haute mindset has helped me achieve things I’m immensely proud of.

Since moving to the U.S., I’ve founded multiple companies in real estate, healthcare and tech. Often called a Renaissance Woman, I possess both breadth and depth of knowledge and the unique ability to integrate multiple industries to create successful business strategies.

This approach has served me well and led to exponential business growth. But I’m not all tenacity and drive; my spiritual upbringing stressed the qualities of humility, empathy, compassion, and kindness.
 
A few years ago, despite my tremendous material success, I still felt unfulfilled. I was looking for purpose and found it after a soul-searching conversation with my mother, who helped me  realize I needed to be more grounded to my values and what mattered most: giving back and creating a legacy of positive impact. I started a nonprofit that leverages fashion to drive positive change through girls' education by supporting organizations leading projects in India. 

Today, I’m an advocate for gender equality and an investor in girls’ education because I understand first-hand how to transform your life into a position of strength.

I'm on a mission to inspire and guide women of color founders and serve as a reminder that they can be whatever they want to be!

With nearly 20 years of experience leading digital transformations across the globe, I understand these challenges intimately.

𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐞𝐫𝐢𝐞𝐧𝐜𝐞𝐬 & 𝐀𝐜𝐡𝐢𝐞𝐯𝐞𝐦𝐞𝐧𝐭𝐬
At industry giants, such as Microsoft and Vodafone, I led major digital transformations such as the modernization of Qatar's legacy systems. This required mastering complex technologies while navigating stakeholder expectations, securing cross-functional buy-in, and driving rapid executions.

𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐃𝐗𝐰𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐒𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲
Founded in 2018, DXwand’s mission is to bridge the Arabic dialect gap in AI and empower businesses with AI that understands the region's unique cultural and linguistic landscape. 
Securing 𝐨𝐯𝐞𝐫 $6 𝐦𝐢𝐥𝐥𝐢𝐨𝐧 in funding, including a pivotal round during the 2023 downturn, validates both our innovative solutions and the region's readiness for our tailored AI. 

𝐈𝐦𝐩𝐚𝐜𝐭 𝐓𝐡𝐫𝐨𝐮𝐠𝐡 𝐋𝐞𝐚𝐝𝐞𝐫𝐬𝐡𝐢𝐩
Exceptional outcomes are only possible with a team driven by one vision. At Vodafone, for example, I was able to secure the company the Microsoft Gold Partner status while simultaneously driving a 30% revenue growth. This was achieved by fostering a culture of strategic thinking and continuous skill development. 

𝐒𝐮𝐜𝐜𝐞𝐬𝐬, 𝐒𝐡𝐚𝐫𝐞𝐝 
I take pride in my role in transforming how sectors interact with their customers through strategic digital initiatives. 

• Consistently surpassing sales quotas (129%, 105% in consecutive years in Microsoft), demonstrating my ability to identify client pain points, develop tailored solutions, and execute strategies.
• My work across the Middle East and Africa (Qatar, UAE, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, Palestine, Pakistan, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Kuwait, Oman, Bahrain, Jordan, Lebanon, Nigeria, Kenya, South Africa, and more) has given me a nuanced understanding of diverse cultural and regulatory contexts. 
• Overcoming initial cloud adoption resistance across Qatar by successfully addressing security concerns and ensuring seamless technology transitions for government clients. 
• Spearheading the transformative launch of Qatar Virtual Learning Environment has enabled me to be part of the leading force behind revolutionizing education delivery across the Middle East region.

They have attracted a substantial audience through consistently publishing new content, and they’re keeping them engaged by following the latest trends and delivering upfront value.

✋ Raise your hand if this is you -

You’re a business owner or marketing professional, providing services or products to a well-defined audience. You know your offers are solid and the value you provide is competitive. Your brand is trustworthy, it’s authoritative, and it’s driven by people that care about their customers.

🛑 But - you’re pulling your hair out.

Because you know another company serving the same space has focused on establishing a significant video presence, which means your competition has an unrivaled ecosystem of warm leads that already know, like, and trust their brand.

But don’t freak out.

💡 For years, Edify has provided video-first content services for high-profile brands, and through our focus on generating leads and retaining engaged subscribers, we have been part of growing numerous brands to 7 or 8 figures - and beyond.

We are proud of decades of proven results in a wide-range of different video solutions. We are on top of cutting-edge methods for building awareness, improving engagement, and nurturing an audience. 💡

Our partners benefit from this when we strategize, produce, distribute, and optimize their video content. 

🔥 We do 90% of the work for you, weaponizing our knowledge to grow your brand.

Just like we did with DigitalMarketer.com.

They currently have more than 60,000 active subscribers on their YouTube channel.

💰 That means whenever they release a new offer, they have a massive audience of warm leads. Our focus on producing high-value and engaging video-first content has ensured a steady pipeline of followers that are ready to give them their money.

Sizzle,Active,Jerome Pesenti,"Sizzle AI, Founder",https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpesenti,"New York, New York, United States","I have been involved with artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and search for the past 25 years. I most recently led the AI team at Meta -- pursuing fundamental and applied research in AI and making Meta products safer and more valuable to people through the use of AI. MetaAI's main contributions during my time there were PyTorch, AI for content moderation, very large models for ads and recommendations, and FAIR's research breakthroughs.

Previously I was co-CEO of BenevolentAI, which develops novel AI technologies that will change how drugs are discovered. Before that, I managed a global team of researchers and software engineers within IBM Watson. My team was doing research and developing state-of-the-art software in question and answering, dialog, speech, natural language processing, and automated machine translation. Our biggest research focus was on leveraging deep learning for all these tasks. We were also responsible for the Watson Developer Cloud, which exposes these technologies as easy-to-consume cloud services.

I joined IBM through its acquisition of Vivisimo, the search and text analytics company I co-founded in 2000. Vivisimo grew organically to 130 employees and had many large corporate and government customers such as P&G, Airbus, J&J, DIA, SSA, and the US Air Force. Vivisimo's technology was based on the machine learning research I conducted with my co-founders in the CS department of CMU from  1998 to 2000. 

On the policy side, I served as co-chair of an independent review on the growth of AI commissioned by the UK government.

Omnee,Active,Dave Johnston,Entrepreneur | Founder at Omnee,https://ca.linkedin.com/in/david-johnston-omnee,"Saskatchewan, Canada","There were a few times our utility services were cut off from overdue bills, and we would boil water to bathe. Twice, we pretended nobody was home when landlords came looking to collect their overdue rent, resulting in evictions. 

These unpleasant experiences put a chip on my shoulder at a young age. Even though I had so much to be thankful for, I swore to myself that someday my own family would never have to feel the shame I felt as a kid.

That said, throughout all those years of struggle, there were also neighbors randomly showing up with groceries for our family. There was the landlord who let us stay much longer than we should have. There was a kind farmer willing to drive my family 100's of km's when our rust bucket (barely a car) broke down on the side of the highway. 

I even remember, when I was about 10 yrs old, a generous local clothing retailer put my very first suit and tie on layaway, so I could slowly pay for it over several months with income from my flyer delivery route.

Back then, I wanted to wear that suit and tie proudly, as I thought that was what success looked like. 

After tasting some wins and losses over two decades as an entrepreneur, it's become increasingly clear that value is mostly found beneath the surface.

In a culture increasingly obsessed with appearances, I'm driven to make an impact that's deeper and more enduring.

I want to be like that farmer, landlord, clothing retailer or neighbour... where helping someone is a reflex, not a performance. I want to create tangible value, empowering others to live a meaningful life and enjoy what matters most.

I didn't want to do a job that just kept the status quo. My first thought was to be an astronaut. I went to Georgia Tech university for aerospace engineering (rocket science) to get closer to that dream. I did not end up reaching that goal immediately, but looks like I'll make it up there sooner than later. However, I think I have now found my way to truly bring humans a leap forward.
 
But first, let me describe how I got to this point. I learned the consumer internet industry from the ground up while helping build badoo.com in Moscow and then set up the London office, constructing Badoo piece by piece scaling from 0 to 70 million users. And then moved on to build AnchorFree from a popular single app company when I joined, to the lead global protector of the Internet with over 700 million users and hundreds of millions in yearly subscription revenue. Leveraging all those skills/experience, I have now embarked on the mission of my life by Co-founding Humanity with my close friend Peter Ward.

Humanity will let the people of the world fight aging damage that robs us of a healthy long life and countless friends and family members. Just in the last 5 years the scientific community has made incredible steps forward in our understanding of what drives loss of function in our bodies over time (aging). We will become a distributor of these solutions, feed data back into the research community and for the first time give our users a concrete feedback loop to track the effectiveness of each intervention/solution.

The technology automates the underwriting process through the power of artificial intelligence and big data, creating a seamless and highly intuitive policy-buying experience where consumers can buy a policy completely online in minutes without a medical exam. 

Bob is a successful entrepreneur and recognized insurance benefits expert.  

Early in Bob’s career, he established himself as an innovator. As a co-founder of Choice Plus of New England, he pioneered the development of level-funded health plans. Bob successfully exited that company in 2006 when it was acquired by Medical Claims Service. After the exit, Bob stayed active in the field by consulting the industry on health plan designs and funding.

During that same period, Bob was a national leader in consumer-driven health plans. As a co-founder of Choice Strategies, he launched the nation’s first debit card-based HRA. Then, the company developed the ability to integrate the employer-provided HRA with the employee’s HSA and FSA. Today, these technologies and personal care accounts are a staple in nearly every employer-sponsored benefit plan in the US.  Bob successfully exited that company in 2012 when it was acquired by WageWorks (now a part of HealthEquity). After the exit, Bob stayed active in the field by consulting InsurTechs, health plans, and employers on the further development of the technology that would bring these plans to the masses.

Over the last 10 years, Bob has founded, invested, advised, and operated innovative companies in the benefit & insurance industry. Maxwell Health: an online benefits administration platform acquired by Sun Life in 2018. Connected Benefits: an online insurance agency acquired by GoHealth in 2016. Limelight Health: a group underwriting platform acquired by Fineos in 2020. GoCo: an online platform for HR, benefits, and payroll.

That’s out of the question now, so I try to fake it by It by applying as much scientific method as I can to product development and entrepreneurship. This has led me to value uncertainty and ambiguity, and have a default setting to “build, measure, learn.” 
 
When an organization decides to embark on using technology, specifically AI, to introduce a new product  to their customer base, they often fail to cross the chasm between “research project” and “desirable product.” I bridge that gap by embodying the values above, being the voice of the customer ad nauseam, evangelizing cross-functional development teams, and relentlessly testing.

- Actively engage with the Hyderabad (India) startup community, working towards building amazing platforms which would help startups connect and network, whether it's for knowledge-sharing or for helping solve their challenges and also raising funds, through events like SaaSt, SaaSBooMi, etc


Solving problems is my passion. I have consistently worked on this through the startups I've built from scratch and the startups and entrepreneurs that I help. I also talk about Product Management, the Usefulness of the products, and building brands. Design drives me every day to build, Strategize and execute better. 

I design(ed) business models, processes, brand strategy, branding, products - hardware and software, go-to-market strategies, growth hacks and if required, exit plans. I have dipped my hands in building both B2B and B2C startups and act as a catalyst to product, design, and development teams.

To gain a deeper understanding of user experience and to understand how behavioral changes can be inculcated through design and psychology, I have worked as an Uber driver for a short period and also washed utensils in mega kitchens when I ventured out into the food industry.

After receiving my BSc in Computer Science and Statistics from Tel Aviv University, I entered the startup world as a software developer, later moving into product management. I guess my childhood inclination to be a part of a ton of extracurriculars led me to get my MBA from Cornell Tech, and eventually pursue entrepreneurship and to become a CEO.

I founded Hyro in 2018 to enable enterprises to deploy and maintain virtual assistants at scale. Since then, we are developing the world’s first Adaptive Communications Platform that makes it easy, fast, and scalable to deploy virtual assistants that improve engagement, operational efficiency, and conversions by helping people have two-way conversations.

It’s an honor to work with Microsoft, Twilio, SCL Health, RentPath, and so many more inspiring companies to improve their business outcomes through our adaptive communications platform. In our constantly digitizing world, these tools are more important than ever.

Since launch, we’ve cracked multi-seven figures, built an all-star team, moved offices (twice), had a baby, got married- and we’re just getting started.

Before Hyro, I was co-founder & CEO of Shine Drink — we scaled to 7,000+ stores, hit $60M+ in retail sales, and won a Telstra Business Award along the way. I also built a Facebook Marketplace-style app before Facebook did (RIP FaceBuy).

These days, I’m all in on building Hyro into a $100M+ brand while trying to be a great dad, run a sub 3-hour marathon, and survive waking up at 424am everyday.

BreachBits,Active,J. Foster Davis,Founder & COO.  Damn the torpedoes.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobfosterdavis,"Little Rock, Arkansas, United States","I lead diverse teams to meet the biggest challenges in cybersecurity, technology, and risk management.  Cyber risk is just like any other risk - so treat it the same.  If you grow a culture of risk management, accountability, and self-inspection - you are on track to building a secure organization.

I believe in the power of ""Red Teaming"" (scrimmaging to ""attack"" your ideas, projects, and organization - making them stronger).  It supports a culture of self-reflection, thought diversity, and risk management that is necessary to create a secure organization. I believe in it so much that I've staked my livelihood on it by co-founding BreachBits, a cyber Red Teaming company that uses automation and AI to do things that humans can't. 

I am inspired by the Liberty-related disciplines of complexity science, performance art, Austrian economics, cybersecurity, capitalism, and organizational theory.  There is a reason these approaches rich in civil liberty produce the best results. 
-> Seek mutual value and respect in your relationships and partnerships. 
-> Lead not by requiring compliance but allowing for initiative.  
-> Regulate not by policing but by interaction.  
-> Do not compel; voluntary efforts will produce an abundance of successful outcomes.  
-> Focus your energy not on catching a culprit, but on recognizing and encouraging goodness.  
-> Defend yourself and your ideas.  They are worth defending.
-> Do not lie to yourself or others - else you will become a slave.  Instead, speak the truth, embolden the truth in others, and face the truth - using it... conquering it.

With over 12 years of experience translating ambitious ideas into impactful realities, I am passionate about creating world-class products that solve real-world problems. 

My professional journey began with a business, a businessman and the team at Custodial I'll always hold in deep regards. As a Management Trainee my initial work experience (2013-2016) provided a strong foundation. I gained deep domain knowledge from building Justdial's Search Plus platform, with expertise in E-Commerce & Payment Gateways. 

At 25, in 2016 I found myself at a profound crossroads, faced with two distinct paths to pursue my passion for Music & Performance Arts as a livelihood: to Confirm to the Conventional (to enter Bollywood), or to leave the country. I chose the road less traveled. Over the next six years, I embraced a global stage, touring 17 countries  and performing in over 1,000 concerts across 50+ cities. This incredible journey not only allowed me to realize my musical ambitions  but also honed my storytelling abilities, instilled a deep appreciation for connecting with diverse audiences, and returned me home with a partner, a pet dog, and the deep satisfaction of a hard-earned ambition.

Since 2022, my focus has shifted back to product innovation, driven by an ambition as strong and a unique sense of déjà vu. As I now immerse myself in building efficient products and managing profitable businesses, I once again perceive two clear options for scaling: 'Confirm to the Conventional' (..I'll leave this to your guess) or 'Leave the Country.' 

My chosen path, however, mirrors my past decision to 'leave the country': it's about creating the kind of world-class jobs and opportunities here in India which contributes towards building world-class products. This is the fuel of my ambition. 

This philosophy fuels my commitment to building Walrus, an innovative SaaS platform for business companions.

Likely from growing up in and around nature, I’ve always been drawn to the complexity of living systems - biological, ecological, human - and the ways we can use new technologies to better understand, guide and collaborate with them.

At Adaviv, we’re building practical technologies that give specialty crop growers visibility and feedback on how their plants and people are performing - in real-time, at scale. Our tools help reduce waste, improve consistency and quality, and unlock new ways to grow better crops and build better farm systems.

I’ve worked across biology, environmental science, data science and design - with a Ph.D. and postdoc research at MIT - but what keeps me going is a fascination with what’s coming next. With AI now accelerating at a wild pace, we’re stepping into a new era of collaboration between people and synthetic intelligence. I think how we build that world is critical to human existence and the earth - including how we grow food in it.

I've been a researcher, writer, consultant, and photographer. My work’s been published in journals and featured in Smithsonian, The Guardian, WSJ, and others.

SmartHop,Active,Joaquin Brillembourg,Strategic Product Leader | Cultural Marketer | Brand-Driven Builder | 0→1 Specialist | Turning Curiosity into Meaning,https://pt.linkedin.com/in/jaba23,Portugal,"I am curious enough to start anything and structured enough to finish the ones that matter. I once read that entrepreneurship is “bringing social change by modifying patterns, driven by holding on to an anomaly.” That idea has guided me for over 20 years: spotting what others overlook and following it wherever it leads.

My work focuses on turning cultural insights and raw ideas into structured systems that teams can build from. I look for tensions people feel but don’t articulate, then design products and frameworks that resolve those tensions with meaning. The goal is to help teams move with clarity while creating things that resonate.

I’ve applied this across logistics, education, fashion, games, and tech, leading ventures from concept to traction. Depending on the context, I work through strategy, product design, game mechanics, or cultural marketing. I use whatever tools the idea demands.

Along the way, I’ve come to see that resonance sits at the intersection of what a product does and what it represents. Cultural marketing taught me that meaning must be embedded in the brand from the beginning. Product design showed me how to shape utility into something intuitive and elegant. Game development taught me that even small interactions can carry emotional weight when they’re designed with care. Strategic leadership taught me how to keep teams focused when the direction is unclear and aligned when the stakes are high.

PeakSyncer,Active,Arthur Wang,Data @ Babylist,https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthurnw,"Portland, Oregon, United States","I help organizations get value from their data - even if they don't know it exists. Consulting experience across industries helps me home in on business objectives to find the ""why"". Broad experience in analytics - including AI/ML, data engineering, and cloud architecture - informs the ""what"" and the ""how"".

I lead and deliver projects by understanding current and future business needs, then designing and implementing solutions to meet those needs. I seek to balance the urgent needs of the present with the aspirations of the future.

When drawing up solutions, I favor a design-first approach that combines experience (getting my hands dirty) and formal learning (reading papers and books). I'm an advocate for technology-agnostic, principles-based design in the early stages of projects, but also get hands-on once the project gets rolling. My skillset includes:

• Python and SQL (Spark SQL, Snowflake)
• Databricks and Apache Spark for data engineering and advanced analytics
• AWS (S3, Lambda, API Gateway, Kinesis, networking, IAM)
• Microsoft Azure (Data Factory, Data Lake Store, DevOps, Event Hub, and Stream Analytics)
• Infrastructure as code (Terraform, Terragrunt)
• Data architecture and pipelines for big data workloads (data lake/lakehouse architecture, lambda architecture, Apache Airflow)
• CI/CD and automation (Python, Bash, and PowerShell scripting, Azure Pipelines)

At Allelica, we develop clinical Multi-Ancestry Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) tests to prevent cardiovascular disease, cancer and neurodegenerative disease and we combine them with traditional genetic testing and clinical risk models to enable the next generation of clinical genomics.

Our diagnostics are used by leading healthcare institutions in the US and internationally to identify individuals who benefit from personalized therapeutic interventions and screening strategies.

We also enable clinical genetics labs to develop and deliver their own PRS-based diagnostics through a decentralized model. With partners like Baylor College of Medicine, we’ve set the industry standard for building clinical PRS tests with scientific rigor, regulatory compliance, and clinical utility.

Our infrastructure supports cloud-based and on-premise deployment, helping labs and biopharma companies run validated, multi-ancestry PRS analyses at scale.

Our work has been published in Circulation, Nature Communications, and the Journal of the American Heart Association, and presented at major global conferences.

We believe that data-driven risk stratification is the future of primary prevention, and that medicine should work better for everyone. By empowering the transition from sick care to true healthcare, we’re helping shift the focus to prevention, and payers are recognizing the value, as our approach not only improves health outcomes but is also cost-effective.

- transforming the company, its organisation and business from a loss-making, low production entity with a short-term future into a profitable, fit-for-purpose, adaptable entity with a long-term future;
- investments of $1.5 billion in the assets over a 6-year period increasing asset integrity and capacity in a responsible manner; 
- rejuvenating reserves with an outstanding 180% Reserves Replacement Ratio; 
- organically adding new resources to the portfolio, extending the business horizon; 
- increasing production after decades of said-irreversible natural decline;
- ensuring compliance with IFC Environmental & Social Performance Standards and ISO14001, with, as a result among many, Sustainalytics ranking Assala Energy's ESG Risk management in the top 7% of Oil & Gas industry.

David’s career began in the French Army's paratroops as an officer.  
In 1996 he returned to Oil & Gas, in line with his academic qualifications, beginning in Gabon with Kelt-Energy (later Perenco), where he held various offshore positions, ultimately becoming Operations Manager and delivering significant growth.

He then moved to Vaalco as their Managing Director in Gabon, setting up their business and successfully developing the offshore pre-salt discovery Etame, and making subsequent discoveries Avouma and Ebouri.

In 2006, David joined Tullow Oil, starting out as Business Manager for the Central & West Africa region, spanning from Angola to Guinea along the West African coast. During this time, Tullow achieved reserves replacements of over 100% in mature assets and carried out new-country entries for high-profile exploration throughout the region. He was then promoted to Senior Advisor to Tullow’s Founder & Chief Executive, troubleshooting the company’s contractual, fiscal, commercial issues across the African Continent.

David holds a Master degree in Process Engineering from France’s National School of Chemical Industries, and a Master degree in Petroleum Engineering and Economics at the French Petroleum Institute (IFP).",52,,Founder & CEO,Geospiza Energy,Founder & CEO,Assala Energy,Tullow Oil,10 yrs 9 mos,IFP School,"Master Degree, Petroleum Engineering & Economics",ENSIC,"Master Degree, Process & Chemical Engineering",Performance Poetry,,,,,15,Co-founder and Senior Director of Silver Lake Partners; Chairman of The Jackson Laboratory; Founder of The Roux Institute at Northeastern University,Founder of The Roux Institute focused on digital engineering and AI; Board member and speaker at Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation; Public engagements related to technology investment and philanthropy,0,8.0,positive,,,,"Co-founded Silver Lake Partners, one of the world’s largest technology-focused private equity firms; Founded Datext, the first commercial CD-ROM publishing company, later acquired by Lotus Software; Founded The Roux Institute at Northeastern University, focused on digital engineering and AI applications",L4,"David Roux demonstrates a strong track record as a proven operator with significant executive experience in the energy sector.

Beagle Learning,Active,James Tanton,Math Educator | Curriculum Developer | Author & Online Course Creator | International Consultant,https://www.linkedin.com/in/james-tanton-9920bb58,"Paradise Valley, Arizona, United States","I am an educator rethinking the college and high school math curriculum to create a more effective and joyous educational experience for all. With a Ph.D. in mathematics from Princeton University, and over 20 years of teaching experience--college and high school--I recently served as the Mathematics Course Architect for an AI-driven tutoring company, but I have primarily worked as an independent education consultant for the past decade. Each year, I consult with schools and colleges globally, accepting an average of 15 national and 15 international invitations per year to help educators transform their approaches to teaching mathematics.

From 2004 to 2011, I designed and conducted core mathematics courses for Northeastern University’s Master’s degree in Mathematics Education and delivered courses for the Harvard Extension School and Math for America’s Washington DC branch. My work has directly engaged over 5,000 mathematics educators, and my curriculum work has reached over 7 million students.

As an author of 16 books on mathematics, I create educational content for The Teaching Company’s GREAT COURSES series and maintain a strong outreach presence on social media. My YouTube videos have garnered over 3.6 million views, and I have shared an original mathematics problem daily on 𝕏 (Twitter) since 2009, amassing 33.6K followers.

In 2016, I co-founded the Global Math Project (GMP) to transform the perception and teaching of mathematics worldwide through my visual approach, Exploding Dots. This initiative has engaged 7.8 million participants from over 150 countries and territories. The impact of Exploding Dots is currently being studied, with ongoing research in schools in Barcelona.

My latest project involves compiling a new program for Developmental Mathematics and College Algebra courses based on the principles of Exploding Dots, with a focus on kindness and human relevance in teaching. I believe that mathematics can be a gateway to meaning, value, and joy for students, and I strive to present concepts in a way that is engaging and accessible. I have also self-published over a dozen curriculum books that reflect this philosophy, with over 10,500 volumes sold.

I am passionate about changing the narrative around mathematics education to make it more inviting and reduce the fear that often surrounds the subject, ultimately encouraging more students to pursue STEM fields.",60,,"The Global Math Project, co-Founder",Freelance,Mathematician at Large,Mathematical Association of America,Co-Founder,Beagle Learning,Princeton University,"PhD, Mathematics",University of Adelaide,"B Sc (Hons), Mathematics/Theoretical Phsyics",Education,Book writing,Mathematics Research,University Teaching,High School Education,0,,"Founder and former CEO of Beagle Learning, an edtech startup focused on building agency, self-efficacy, and critical thinking skills",0,3.0,neutral,,,,"Winner of the Kidder Faculty Prize; Author of over ten books on mathematics and education; Creator of popular mathematics videos on YouTube with over 2,100,000 views as of 2024; Visiting scholar at the Mathematical Association of America",L3,"James Tanton demonstrates extensive technical expertise and thought leadership in mathematics education, fitting the L3 'Technical and Management Veterans' profile.

Apaly Health,Active,Jerry Beinhauer MD,Apaly - Advanced Primary Care Plus (APC+) for Employees and their Families,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jbeinhauer,"Tampa, Florida, United States","I often joke that I am part physician – part techie nerd.  As far back as I can remember, I have always had a love for healthcare and technology.  Throughout my life, these interests have often carried me down several distinct, frequently separate, but sometimes briefly intersecting career paths.  Prior to medical school, I worked in network engineering. During medical school, because of my technology background, I served as a technology consultant for healthcare providers (medical students will do pretty much anything for money or FOOD).  After residency, I started a hospitalist practice. However, I had always felt the strong desire to merge my passions together into a single parallel trajectory.

My inspiration to launch Apaly Health was triggered by my profound belief that as the U.S. healthcare system developed into the massive industry that it is today, a core concept was frequently being overlooked: PEOPLE.  The fundamental and most important event that drives everything in our entire healthcare system, is the physician – patient interaction. Without this interaction between PEOPLE, nothing else matters.

This is why at Apaly Health, we believe that healthcare should revolve around this interaction between the patient and physician, and that all other components in our healthcare system should exist to seamlessly support this process, while creating an epic experience, improving health and wellness, and lowering overall costs.",57,,Chief Executive Officer,Apaly Health · Full-time,CEO,Auronexus,"Co-Founder, Director",CoRemedy Hospitalists,Southwest Georgia Family Medicine Residency,Family Medicine Residency Program,Central America Health Sciences University,Doctor of Medicine (M.D.),Entrepreneurship,Strategic Planning,Healthcare,Healthcare Management,Hospitals,0,,Speaker profile on Sessionize highlighting experience in healthcare and technology sectors,0,6.0,positive,,,,,L2,"The founder shows an interesting combination of medical and technical expertise, but appears to be an early-stage entrepreneur in their first significant venture.

I've always been fascinated by the potential of autonomous technologies to solve real-world problems. While studying at Harvard in 2017, I had an idea for a banking system that could autonomously manage our finances to make our lives easier. With the support of the MIT Innovation Sandbox fund and our wonderful community of backers, we launched Envel's autonomous banking service to consumers in the US in 2020. Our vision is to revolutionize the way people manage their finances by using the latest advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning. I'm passionate about creating products that make people's lives easier, and Envel is just the beginning.

Кстати не имея компьютера и интернета дома! 👩‍💻

И сказать честно…ненавидела весь этот процесс так как все было очень сложным и непонятным! Мы изучали электротехнику, сети и связи и языки программирования C и C++ которые не используются в современном мире и очень тяжелые так как полностью связаны с математикой!

А мне еще в младших классах повесили ярлык ГУМАНИТАРИЙ и в итоге я боялась всего что связано с математикой! А изучение инженерии на тот момент полностью было вокруг математики 👩‍🏫

Я много раз хотела бросить изучение Инженерии и Программирования так как была уверена что у меня не получится! Сейчас конечно я понимаю что любую профессию может освоить любой человек- даже якобы ГУМАНИТАРИЙ (кстати эти ярлыки в школе очень устаревшая система от которой нужно избавиться)

Много лет спустя когда уже работала в ИТ сфере, заметила что все спрашивают один и тот же вопрос: а у меня получиться если я плохо знаю математику? И чаще всего не идут изучать Цифровые навыки и ИТ профессии, хотя это была их мечта и шанс получить хорошую работу!

И тогда в 2020 году родилась идея что мы можем сделать обучение Цифровым навыкам и ИТ профессий доступным и простым! Мы конечно в начале думали что Автоматизируем сами Образовательные центры и таким образом поможем их студентам получить более удобное и доступное образование!!! Так появилась наша первая B2B компания Codify LMS 

Позже пришло понимание что мы сами можем делать обучение Цифровым навыкам и ИТ профессиям более доступным! Даже для гуманитариев как я 😅

This ability to read trends, alongside my ability to express ideas clearly, have allowed me to work with some of the most important names in technology.

I am currently building Practice, a world class tool to help tutors, coaches, and other teams of service providers manage their business. Our team is small and awesome, and our customers love us. Expect to hear more about Practice soon.

My previous venture, Breather, was an on-demand flexible office company we built from the ground up starting in 2013. It was been covered by CNN, Fast Company (twice), TechCrunch, The Verge, and a ton of other publications. We raised over $150m from some of the best investors in the world to build it.

As Breather's CEO, I was responsible for hiring world-class talent, raising funds, directing strategy, finding locations, building partnerships and much more.

Prior to this, I was (still am) a New York Times bestselling author of business and marketing books. My co-author and myself were among to the first to write books about social media and how to use it for business purposes, and many of the best practices you see in the field were first put on paper by us first.

I've worked closely with one of those founders, Nikolas Kairinos, for some 15 years, on various AI related and deep-tech projects.

I am responsible for the 'tone of voice' that Soffos uses to output messages, recommendations, answers to questions etc etc. I also produce and / or proof most of our public facing documentation, such as video scripts, business plans, newsletters, blogs, whitepapers and the like. 

In short, in terms of Soffos, Inc. before the public gets to see anything, it's (usually) me who's written it or proofed it, so the buck stops here!

The Soffos platform is an AI driven employee learning and development ecosystem, providing succinct job-related answers anytime anywhere for employees on their own devices.   

Soffos' unique differentiator from other learning platforms is the way that it solves a central corporate training problem - that of knowledge changing so fast that by the time curricula have been manually prepared by humans the knowledge is already outdated. This is simply unscalable. Corporate training is therefore broken.

Soffos' autonomous ingestion of unordered documentation converts the information locked away within thousands of files into 'knowledge nuggets' - then presented as succinct accurate answers, through spoken or typed natural language, to employees wherever they may be in the world, within moments of the resources being uploaded.

Pressure on HR to stay composed while managing something they were never trained to do.

In the early days of Google Glass, we focused on creating stylish hardware without a well-defined understanding of how consumers would use it in their everyday lives. 
Instead, strong enterprise/industry/defense adoption happened and custom niche applications where developed in the field. HoloLens and Magic Leap went through the same awakening a few years later. 
I strongly believe today that for consumers, use case comes first and dictate product PRD (Product Requirement Document) and hardware ERS (Engineering Requirements Sheet) to best deliver generic use cases.

Today, widespread consumer adoption of smart glasses is finally within reach thanks to 3 key factors:

1) A robust AR hardware ecosystem of vendors, contract manufacturers and start-ups, grown organically, specializing in key AR sub-systems (display, imaging, sensing,...)
2) Generic platforms emerging to provide compelling user experiences (Vision OS, Android XR, Meta Horizon,...)
3) All-day use cases powered by Multimodal AI Agentic Assistant as Gemini/Astra are driving demand for always-on consumer smart glasses.

Initially I started a TV distribution company from a barn on a farm, then was struck by the idea for The Extreme Sports Channel. Found some fantastic people to back us with a big chunk of money, then had an incredible time running around the world launching it in 68 countries, reaching 100m subscribers and successfully exiting to Liberty Global the owners of F1.

Today with an incredible team I am building Wavelength a social-first media company operating at the heart of the creator economy. In today’s fragmented media landscape we help brands, agencies and destinations break through the noise by delivering high-impact social campaigns through authentic storytelling and strategic creator partnerships.

We operate a network of brand-led social publishers, YouTube channels and creators that reach over 950 million people per month and have a combined audience of over 350 million followers across Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok. We cater to specific passion points and niche audiences, driving engagement through daily short-form content, premium long-form formats and live events across adventure travel, action sports, beauty, DIY, craft, e-automotive, tech, and envirotainment.

Partnering with social media publishers and leading creators that already have a strong fan base and deep community engagement, we help monetise their reach, supercharge their engagement, increase subscribers, and unlock long-term brand value.

We work with top TV producers, sports rights holders, and distributors to reformat premium long-form content for YouTube and short-form social. We take a social-first formatting approach, reviving iconic programming for Gen Z and Millennial audiences where they watch, scroll, and connect.

We have assembled and united top talent from YouTube, Meta, Spotify, Google, Universal Music, and McCann to create a new kind of media company. We are headquartered in London and are establishing hubs in New York and Los Angeles. So if you’re a brand, creator, social publisher or sports rights holder looking to win in the creator economy—we would love to talk!

for business leaders every day.

tell us we're not looking for the needle in the haystack - like explorers.

Analytics8.

- Engineers build to innovate, and I strongly believe that without data, innovation
would be impossible.

He also saw how 21st-century management will be disrupted–by applying machine learning to employees working and humans leading–and have a positive, lasting impact on employees and companies. That’s why he founded enaible to bring data science to leadership science, it’s now possible to know and do what was impossible.

Prior to founding enaible, Dr. Weir spent two decades coaching CEOs and conducting cutting-edge leadership research, which allowed him to see how flat productivity creates unnecessary margin pressure. Combining his rich leadership experience with breakthrough data science methodologies, as founder and CEO of enaible Inc., he now focuses on applying AI to help employees Get Better | Work Smarter | Achieve More.

In addition to developing new AI solutions for business leaders and leading businesses, Dr. Weir is a prolific author. His books on leadership have earned numerous accolades, including #1 best-seller status on Amazon, First Finalist in the International Book Awards, and the #2 book in the Wall Street Journal’s Readers Poll.

Cohereum,Closed,Björn Stansvik,CEO at Byggr.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/in/bstansvik,San Francisco Bay Area,"As CEO and Co-founder of Byggr.ai since March 1, 2024, I now lead an innovative company based in San Francisco that is transforming the software development industry. Byggr.ai empowers development teams with a novel, patented approach using our proprietary foundational AI model, DALMA (Deterministic Architectural Language Model Algorithm). DALMA is not just another LLM-based code completion tool. While LLMs are great at synthesizing human thought, they are less effective at generating precise, large-scale syntax for entire applications. We use LLMs to bootstrap human intentions, translating them into a machine-readable “abstract model.” DALMA then processes this model to create limitless, tested, and architecturally sound source code.

In software development, we’ve seen the evolution from Waterfall to Agile. Now, Byggr is introducing the next generation of development: The Byggr Studio. Visit Byggr.ai to join the waitlist and be among the first to know before we make headlines. Whether you're a startup looking to get to market faster, an IT services firm seeking to outpace competitors, or a builder aiming to reduce technical debt, DALMA is the industry’s first AI architect, developer, quality assurance, and business analyst - combined into one.

Before Byggr, I spent over two decades building MentorMate from the ground up. After immigrating from Sweden to Minnesota, I grew the company from scratch, bootstrapping to 1,100 employees across 40 countries, culminating in a 9-figure exit to Tietoevry. Founded in 2001, MentorMate grew into a global leader in software design and development. We pioneered solutions that helped clients envision the future of their digital platforms. I vividly recall pitching an early mobile cloud learning app to investors who doubted mobile technology would be a big market for at least five more years. We prevailed by staying ahead of the curve, just as Byggr is now shaping the future of AI-driven software development.

MentorMate’s global reach, with offices in the U.S., Sweden, Bulgaria, and Paraguay, allowed us to deliver world-class design and development services worldwide. This same commitment to innovation at scale (a Byggr scale!) drives me at Byggr.ai, where we are redefining software development through our cutting-edge, in-house foundational AI model, DALMA, making our services accessible and impactful to clients around the globe, thereby democratizing software development.",50,,Chief Executive Officer,Byggr.ai · Full-time,Advisor,PX3 Partners · Part-time,Mentor,Techstars,Stockholm School of Economics Executive Education,Accelerating Digital Innovation,"School of Business, Economics and Law at the University of Gothenburg","MBA, MSc., International Business, Political Science, Engineering",Educational Psychology,Company Building,Sales & Marketing,Mobile Applications,Start-ups,3,,Speaker at 'Two Sides of AI' seminar organized by AI Innovation of Sweden in 2019,0,6.0,neutral,,,,"Steered MentorMate from inception to 700 employees and multiple offices; MentorMate named Top ICT Employer in Bulgaria and Top Workplace in Minnesota; MentorMate recognized on Inc. 500 | 5000 and Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s Fast 50 lists; Recipient of Minneapolis/St. Paul Business Journal’s 40 Under 40 and Titans of Technology (2014); Minnesota Business Magazine’s Real Power 50 (2014); EY Entrepreneur Of The Year Program finalist (2015, 2016)",L7,"Björn Stansvik demonstrates the characteristics of an L7 Elite Serial Entrepreneur based on his proven track record of building and successfully exiting MentorMate at a significant valuation (9-figure exit, implying >$100M) and now founding a new innovative AI company.

Founder at 👉 SuperRep.ai, an 🤖 AI BDR/SDR for b2b outbound Sales.

I am deeply passionate about the four product joys. The joy of innovating, the joy of selling, the joy of subscribing and the joy of customer success.

A non-believer in traditional approaches, I am convinced that the world is changing faster than ever before. The future belongs to those who will adapt. The big and the muscular will get outpaced by the lean and agile. Ability to unlearn is more critical than decades of old school experience. Market-share is dead, mind-share is the new arena where the winners are decided.

In the Subscription economy, acquisition is not enough. It is all about delivering value and ensuring success for your customers over creating fat shelf-ware. 

I do not bet on gut, but rather on enlightenment from experiments that prove the hypothesis either right or wrong. Remember, its always easy to be different but difficult to be better.

Reaching customers has never been so easy, but only for those who are plugged in this connected world. Those stuck in the traditional ways continue to struggle in a loosing battle. Today is about being open, being truthful, about listening and about engaging. Mindless one way spamming of advertisement is old and slow, unbiased social proof is key to success.
