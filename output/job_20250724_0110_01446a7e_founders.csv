👨‍🎤 Before: Head of Marketing at HuggingFace. COO & Co-founder at MonkeyLearn (acquired)
🦾 11+ years of experience working in AI.
👨‍🔬 Advisor at several tech startups.

👋 Hello! I'm Federico, CEO & Founder of WordCrafter, an AI copilot for SEO teams. Our AI identifies your target keyword's search intents, pinpoints key topics and writes engaging content optimized for search engines.

Previously, I was the Head of Marketing at Hugging Face, the fastest-growing community and most used platform for machine learning. As the first marketing hire at Hugging Face, I played a pivotal role in driving revenue growth and establishing foundational marketing strategies. I contributed to the design, launch, and expansion of Hugging Face's paid offerings, developing and executing marketing channels that effectively generated leads and drove adoption. These initiatives were instrumental in scaling annual recurring revenue from $0.5M to $20M. Additionally, my efforts supported Hugging Face in securing a $100M Series C funding round at a $2B valuation in 2022.

Before Hugging Face, I co-founded MonkeyLearn, a platform for analyzing text data with machine learning. Customers like Snapchat, GitHub, Salesforce, Atlassian and Stanford University used MonkeyLearn to analyze text data like customer feedback or support tickets to get insights and automate manual tasks. For more than seven years, I was COO and led the company's go-to-market strategy, including marketing, sales, operations and customer success. MonkeyLearn was acquired by Medallia.

In my spare time, I love helping tech companies refine their go-to-market strategies as an advisor. I enjoy guiding them through GTM challenges, using my experience from past successes and failures to help them find practical, effective solutions. I aim to help these companies sharpen their decision-making, unlock new opportunities and grow faster.

I specialize in B2B SaaS and have deep expertise in marketing, sales, and customer success. Additionally, I know how to code and have over 11 years of experience working in artificial intelligence.

Desde muy joven, la cancha de baloncesto me enseñó la importancia de la estrategia, la anticipación y, sobre todo, el trabajo en equipo.

Y es que cuando estás en la cancha, cada pase, cada jugada tiene un impacto: por lo que no es aconsejable recurrir a la improvisación. La misma mentalidad de juego la aplico hoy en mi carrera, donde transformo datos complejos en decisiones claras y estratégicas para las marcas.

Lo que inició como una visión enfocada en el análisis de datos, evolucionó hasta convertirse en Séntisis Intelligence, la compañía que fundé para interpretar con precisión las conversaciones del entorno digital y convertirlas en inteligencia estratégica.

Desde 2012, hemos ayudado a más de 100 grandes marcas, como Banco Santander, Heineken, Vodafone y LaLiga, a tomar decisiones informadas a partir del análisis profundo de las redes sociales, encuestas y experiencia de clientes.

Pero más que la tecnología en sí misma, me inspira dar un sentido más estratégico y humano al análisis de datos. Al igual que en una jugada de baloncesto, donde la conexión con el equipo y la intuición marcan la diferencia, el análisis de datos debe ir más allá de lo técnico: es una herramienta clave para anticipar cambios, comprender a los clientes en toda su complejidad y tomar decisiones con rapidez y precisión.

Ese es mi reto diario en Séntisis Intelligence y ahora, también con YN+, una nueva iniciativa que fortalece nuestra visión de ofrecer consultoría avanzada en un entorno digital en constante evolución. A través de YN+, expandimos nuestra capacidad de análisis más allá de las RRSS, consolidando nuestra presencia en un ecosistema de datos que abarca todas las dimensiones del ámbito digital.

Sigo entrenando baloncesto y, en cada partido, confirmo que la perseverancia y la pasión marcan la diferencia tanto en la cancha como en la construcción de proyectos sólidos. Del mismo modo, en Séntisis Intelligence e YN+ avanzamos con determinación, fortaleciendo cada estrategia y transformando cada desafío en una oportunidad de crecimiento.

Aigora,John Ennis,"President Aigora, CEO Tulle",https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnmichaelennis,Greater Richmond Region,"Life is full of surprises. I initially expected to become a math professor, but as I finished my PhD, I realized my passion lay in something more closely tied to real-world experience. This led me to a postdoc in computational neuroscience, programming neural networks to study human category learning.

After my postdoc, I spent ten enriching years as a market research consultant at The Institute for Perception. There, I discovered my love for the intersection of mathematics and sensory science, engaging in publishing, teaching, managing projects, and building meaningful connections. Eventually, I founded my own company, Aigora, dedicated to empowering sensory and consumer scientists to leverage artificial intelligence.

Driven by my conviction in AI’s transformative power, I also founded Tulle in 2022—an AI venture aimed at optimizing trade and exploring new frontiers in asset exchange. This period profoundly expanded my expertise in advanced AI implementation, startup scaling, fundraising, and overcoming the practical challenges of introducing groundbreaking technology to the market.

Recently, another unexpected turn arose when Aigora's president stepped down for personal reasons. Recognizing the need for experienced leadership—and seeing the AI-powered future I envisioned back in 2019 now becoming reality—I stepped back in as Chairman. While still guiding Tulle, my current focus is steering Aigora through its next crucial phase, ensuring we seize this transformative moment.

AI has matured significantly, finally acheiving it's full ability to deliver practical tools poised to reshape sensory and consumer science. Our goal at Aigora is integrating sophisticated AI systems deeply into our offerings and internal operations, drawing insights from foundational experiences at Aigora and cutting-edge advancements at Tulle.

We're shifting from isolated tools to embedding AI as intelligent ""Thinking Partners"" within workflows, aiming to augment teams, clarify goals, simplify complexity, accelerate insights, and unlock collective potential—potentially boosting productivity by 5x or more. We're pioneering this future within Aigora, embodying the transformation for which we advocate.

From diplomatic negotiations to global summits, I’ve helped organizations bridge cultural and linguistic divides, ensuring that critical conversations happen seamlessly, even under pressure.

I’ve played a key role in shaping the technology and infrastructure that transformed how interpretation services are delivered worldwide.

I believe that, much like interpreting, leadership requires deep listening, the ability to anticipate challenges, and the agility to make split-second decisions with clarity and confidence.

Through mentoring, coaching, and storytelling, I help leaders and organizations refine their message, inspire action, and connect with their audiences in meaningful ways. My experience working across industries has shown me that the principles of high-stakes interpretation—focus, adaptability, and precision—are just as critical in boardrooms as they are in live events.

My diverse journey spans becoming a British racing driver champion to running a 30-person business at the age of 18. A natural public speaker with refreshing transparency and a no-nonsense approach, I've led 17 funding rounds with a 100% win rate, securing investment from top-tier funds from Andreessen Horowitz to Boost Capital. Honoured as UK AI COO of the Year by C-Insider.

My lifelong passion: transforming everyday physical experiences with cutting-edge technology, with a recent focus on applied AI and real-world impact. Each of my ventures has redefined retail & hospitality; optimising supermarkets' profitability with Edgify and Olio, connecting the unconnected at Mattr, revolutionising the high street at nez, and immersifying IRL events with Volta.

A proven leader with an insatiable growth mindset, I've built and guided enterprise-size teams, acquiring over 5 million users and thousands of partners, from the likes of Microsoft, DELL, and Unity. Successfully launched and scaled 9 businesses from Pre-Seed to Series C, all built with data-driven design at the forefront. 

With extensive experience in complex negotiations, I've executed over £30 billion in trades and raised £20 billion in capital for government, institutional, and large-cap multinational clients. I'm a Techstars alumni, participate in sought-after networks like ICE & Founders Capital, and was awarded TIME's Best Inventions of 2021.
