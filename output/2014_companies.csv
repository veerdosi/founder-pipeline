"DataNovo, Inc.","One of the core purposes of legal tech products is to shrink the time and effort needed for early case management and trial preparation. To achieve that goal, DataNovo has created the first AI- and machine learning-based system that offers three core features: (1) licensing; (2) AI-driven prior art searches; and (3) patent analytics.  For licensing, with a single key stroke, DataNovo's Software-as-a-Service platform allows any individual or corporate entity to identify potential infringers and associated infringing products to every U.S. patent, and helps patent owners advance monetization efforts and secure licensing opportunities.  For AI-driven prior art searches, with a single patent number (instead of keywords), DataNovo offers users the best prior art against that patent instantaneously. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, DataNovo aims to reduce search speed, improve result accuracy, and minimize cost. Companies interested in patent landscape can also use DataNovo's patented platform to check if their new product may infringe on any existing patent.   For patent analytics, which are suited for patent owners or business competitors who are looking to gather, analyze, and assess patent validity strength before pursuing or defending patent lawsuits, advancing licensing deals, or structuring M&A transactions, DataNovo's business intelligence helps facilitate real-world settlement, licensing, and purchase negotiations.  With DataNovo, companies are able to obtain stronger, more defensible patents, challenge frivolous lawsuits, assess critical licensing or infringing intelligence, and make informed business and strategic decisions throughout the companies'​ life cycles.",2014,122000.0,1,2019-01-01,122000.0,San Francisco,California,United States,,Alex Chan|Alexander Loginov,30,"""AI-Driven Legal Tech for Patent Management Solutions""",https://www.datanovo.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/datanovo-inc-?trk=company_logo,0.5,15.0,3.5,10,unknown,0.85,4.0,3.5,0.1,3.0

This means a user can only see what was recorded at a particular time frame on each of the installed cameras. Faceter makes video surveillance systems much more capable by adding face recognition technology. Faceter can build a list of office workers, family members, restaurant patrons; generate a report on who was detected and when, in the cameras' scope; find each occurrence of a specific person at a specific location and retrieve specific records from the archive.Faceter can be taught to respond to certain events. For example, the system can send SMS to parents when their child arrives from school, and transmit information to integrated systems via available APIs. It could be a smart house management platform that will send a command to warm up food in the microwave.
