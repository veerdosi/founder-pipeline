Skild AI,Active,Anil Rathi,CEO at Skild | Innovation Challenge®,https://www.linkedin.com/in/anilrathi,"Los Angeles, California, United States","When Anil was a kid, he had an insatiable curiosity. He was drawn to problems that needed solving, dedicating himself to figuring out how to improve things and make life better. One of those problems was his own. ""I was born with one ear,"" he reveals. ""I couldn't hear until I had 18 surgeries.”

As with every other challenge he faced, he sought solutions, leading him down a path where problem-solving became a way of life. He kept a book of inventions and even called consumer electronics companies, pitching his way to product managers and R&D departments. But the response was always the same: ""Sorry, we don't accept third-party ideas.""

""Why"" he wondered, ""do these companies not pay attention to other avenues of innovation? Why miss out on the next growth opportunity?""

At last, he'd found the problem — the one he'd dedicate his career to solving. ""For the past 20 years, I've made it my mission to carve out a crossroads where organizations can easily access curated networks of high-quality innovators from all walks of life, who can come together and share their ideas for a tech-enabled future,"" he says.

During this time, he has produced more than 600 challenges generating over $300 million in prizes for organizations like Cisco, LG, and The Department of Energy. Just as critically, he's harnessed those experiences to cultivate vibrant tech-scouting networks that have their finger on the pulse of technological innovation around the globe. ""The sheer data on emerging technologies can be overwhelming, and the vastness can slow us down,"" he notes. ""Few organizations have the time, resources, and expertise to engage a larger and more diverse crowd. This is precisely where tech-scouting networks step in.""

Today, Anil and his team oversee networks connecting companies to a diverse ecosystem of technology scouts. ""These networks help connect the dots to what executives are looking for,"" he says. ""They allow us access to relationships, technology, and emerging trends, arming us with the insights to stay ahead of the game. Building these networks isn't about casting the widest net — it's about casting the right net. With a time-box event like an innovation challenge, you can rapidly amass a lot of the right networks of the people who will be your eyes and ears.""

Solving problems and making life better isn't what it used to be. With the rapid acceleration of AI, not to mention the convergence and cross-pollination of dozens of emerging technologies, connecting the dots is more difficult — and more important — than ever before.",50,,CEO & Founder,Skild · Full-time,Creator,Innovation Challenge,Board Member,The House Institute Foundation ,University of Wisconsin-Madison,"BBA, Marketing and International Business",Thunderbird School of Global Management,"MBA-IM, General Management",Board Search,Board Administration,Entrepreneurship,Leadership,Strategy,3,Forward Under 40 Award by University of Wisconsin-Madison; Enshrined in 'Progress' section of University of Wisconsin-Madison Alumni Park,Participated in breakout panels during University of Wisconsin-Madison homecoming weekend; Featured in Harvard Business Review publications,12000,8.0,positive,,,,"Creator of the Innovation Challenge, the world's largest and most established online innovation competition; Honored by University of Wisconsin-Madison by enshrinement in Alumni Park's Progress section; Recipient of the Wisconsin Alumni Association's Forward Under 40 Award",L4,"Anil Rathi demonstrates characteristics of a Proven Operator (L4) based on his 20+ year track record building and scaling Skild, which has become a significant player in the innovation challenge space.

Eudia,Active,Omar Haroun,"Co-Founder & CEO @ Eudia | Building Augmented Intelligence for CLOs that scales legal judgment, accelerates strategic work, and eliminates repetition.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/omarharoun,San Francisco Bay Area,"After the life-changing exit of my last company, Text IQ, I had time to reflect. We built something extraordinary—AI that served some of the most sophisticated in-house legal teams in the world. But despite our success, I couldn’t shake a deeper truth: we hadn’t done enough to truly change the industry.

Legal is still trapped in an outdated playbook. Even the most forward-thinking CLOs—those who want to operate like business leaders, not just legal guardians—are held back by structural constraints.

Legal know-how is scattered across inboxes, folders, documents, and memory. Strategic context—like how your company handled a high-risk decision two years ago—is often impossible to retrieve, killing leverage and making AI outputs generic at best, dangerous at worst.

Meanwhile, law firms profit from starting over, are financially rewarded for inefficiency, and most software vendors don’t go deep enough to solve real legal work.

These problems aren’t just operational—they’re existential. 90% of Americans are one legal event away from bankruptcy. And inside companies, legal is often seen as a blocker, when CLOs want to be builders.

That’s why I started Eudia.

We're not building artificial intelligence to replace lawyers. We're building augmented intelligence to empower them—to give legal teams the tools they need to move faster, think deeper, and build reusable, strategic intelligence inside the enterprise.

Eudia exists to help people achieve their greatest human potential—eudaimonia—by returning judgment back to those who must live with it: the company itself.

Our platform creates something we call a Company Brain: a continuously learning legal knowledge engine that unifies data, embeds judgment, and compounds value over time. It’s AI-native, human-aligned, and built for the strong CLO who is ready to transform legal from a cost center into a source of business velocity.

If you’re:
• A CLO looking to modernize your legal org with real AI,
• A builder who believes tech should support—not overwrite—human wisdom,
• Or someone who knows it’s time to move past legacy systems and create something different,

Let’s talk.
Follow along.

Tabs is an agentic platform for Finance that automates the administration of customer contracts, billing, revenue recognition, renewals, and audits. CFOs often describe it as the Rippling or Ramp equivalent for revenue automation. Our “commercial graph” ingests (1) customer records (e.g., MSAs, order forms, amendments, Stripe data, emails, CRM data) and (2) usage sources (e.g., BI tools, first-party CSV uploads) to automatically surface key terms, create billing schedules, and generate invoices—supporting any pricing model without the need for structured data mapping or heavy implementation. Our automated workflows enable seamless invoice delivery (via email or directly into AP portals), modern dunning, and cash application, all within a single platform, while integrating with tax providers, major payment rails, and general ledgers/ERPs such as QuickBooks and NetSuite. Tabs also includes built-in advanced analytics, reporting, and ASC 606-compliant revenue recognition. On average, Tabs saves finance teams hundreds of human hours per year while reducing the average time to collect by approximately 20 days.

In a $35 trillion asset class long underserved by legacy tools, traditional systems have focused narrowly on extracting key data points—often requiring manual labor and leaving knowledge buried in unstructured text. As a result, data lives in silos, intelligence remain inaccessible, and meaningful action is disjointed.

Her goal is to empower real estate professionals with AI tools that are an extension of their thinking—natural, intuitive, and indispensable.

A serial entrepreneur and business leader across Real Estate, Business Coaching, and Hospitality, Sienam previously served as Head of Enterprise Sales at WeWork India and was a top-producing real estate broker at Corcoran and Compass, where she won the Rookie of the Year award and sold over $100 million in New York City real estate. Her passion for the $35 trillion real estate industry drives her mission to modernize its legacy operations through cutting-edge AI.

Sienam has coached over 50 startups—including unicorns and participants in Techstars and corporate incubators for Standard Chartered Bank, Rolls Royce, and Shell—on setting and executing OKRs. She also built and scaled an award-winning hospitality business in New York and four surrounding states that introduced America to Indian-Chinese hyphenated cuisine, earning recognition from The New York Times, The New Yorker, Fox News, and Time Out. Sienam and her business were featured in The Search for General Tso, a documentary film that premiered at the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival.

A committed community builder, Sienam was part of the Mayor's Office outreach during Hurricane Sandy, where she helped feed 10,000 people, and won the Vendy Hero award for the efforts.

This approach allows extreme efficiency while unlocking an organization's ability for its people to focus their time on tackling the thornier business problems best solved by humans. Generative AI has provided a step-wise shift in our ability to automate within organizations, further fueling my excitement.

I studied Systems Engineering (think process automation with a deep engineering lens) at the United States Military Academy at West Point, and later received my MBA from Harvard Business School, where I focused on the intersection of entrepreneurship and enterprise technology adoption.

I've designed and delivered end-to-end automation solutions for the past 14 years, including process automations within B2B SAAS, B2B2C SAAS, FinTech, Commerce, Supply Chain, and Government.
At the last company I founded, we automated an end-to-end manufacturing process with innovations across software and hardware, combined with best-in-class process management to deliver industry-leading turnaround times for custom products.

I've been in continuous positions of leadership for the past 14 years, leading teams from 2 to 200 people across my time at West Point, Army Special Operations, Harvard Business School, and the past 5 years building technology companies.

I'm the Co-Founder and CEO at Blitzy, The emerging leader in System 2 AI.  Blitzy enables development teams to transform six-month software projects into six-day turnarounds.  The autonomous development platform enables thousands of AI Agents to ‘think’ and cooperate for hours to bulk build software with precision.

In order not to go broke, we had to get users to stay on the platform long enough. And for that we had to talk to them. 

Problem was: We couldn’t talk to 1,000s of users 1on1. 

So we built an AI to do it for us. 

One that listens to every customer and deeply understands what they care about.

It worked so well that we thought: 

What if every company could do this?

- Talk to hundreds of customers simultaneously
- Listen to & understand their preferences
- Turn them into actionable insights

This is exactly what Listen Labs does today.

Whether you're testing products or exploring new markets, Listen is a skilled researcher that works 24/7, delivering insights in hours instead of weeks.

Leading companies like Microsoft, Canva, Chubbies, and others use our insights to make more customer-driven decisions.

Since our inception in 2023, we've been committed to accelerating the adoption of AI-driven solutions without compromising on security.

Prior to my journey at Harmonic, I served as the CTO at Digital Shadows, where I led efforts to proactively identify and mitigate digital risks for organizations worldwide. Our pioneering work in monitoring the internet for cyber threats, data leaks, and reputational risks culminated in the company's acquisition by ReliaQuest for $160 million in 2022. During my tenure, Digital Shadows garnered recognition for innovation from esteemed institutions such as 10 Downing Street, SWIFT, and Cisco. Notably, we were honored as a Gartner Cool Vendor in 2013 and played a pivotal role in shaping industry standards, including the development of the CBEST cyber threat standard in collaboration with the Bank of England.

My journey in the tech industry began as a Technical Architect, where I specialized in designing and implementing robust cyber security and risk management programs for secure government agencies and Fortune 1000 clients at BAE Systems Applied Intelligence.

With a deep-rooted passion for innovation and a proven track record of delivering impactful solutions, I'm driven to continue pushing boundaries and shaping the future of technology in service of a safer, more secure digital landscape.

Earlier in my career, I held engineering, consulting, business development and leadership roles for 12 years working in the telecom and the VoIP space.

The knowledge and experiences I gained from these roles gave me the foundation to jump into cloud in 2015, specifically focusing on AWS.

In 2018 I joined Onica as a Solution Architect and pivoted to fully focus on AI/ML, which was then acquired by Rackspace. This led me to join Hugging Face as an early hire on their monetization team.

After Hugging Face, I joined Roboflow to lead their field engineering and partnership efforts.

In 2023, I had a vision to empower enterprises with industry-specific AI solutions. This idea emerged from my time at Hugging Face where I helped spearhead the monetization team, collaborating with high-profile enterprises.

For the last 18 years, I've been solving problems that I faced personally across different ventures. Answers to it, has led me to start businesses across 5 cities, 4 continents, and diverse industries like e-commerce, retail, wholesale, engineering, energy storage solutions, and tech.

Looking back, here are some of the ventures I started that have shaped the person I am today:

Kira Frozen Foods (200&): At 19, I began selling frozen food products to small restaurants and consumers, scaling the business to supply 35 chains and building a customer base of 10,000 regular consumers.

Kira Floorings (2009): Founded this company and quickly grew it into Egypt's market leader, capturing 40% of the market with a team of 150 professionals.

Ideal Coverings LLC (2015): Expanded into Dubai, establishing Ideal Coverings as a leader in flooring solutions across the UAE, with a portfolio of landmark projects featuring the most iconic developments in Dubai.

KPS Egypt (2017): Co-founded and established KPS as the exclusive distributor of Enersys, supplying 70% of the telecom market Lithium & Lead-Acid batteries need in Egypt.

Greta Boutique (2019): Co-founded this Dubai-based e-commerce store for girls' fashion, focusing on playful, unique styles, and educating young girls about healthy fashion choices.

Through these ventures, I’ve learned a lot about business. In particular, I've learnt to rally together a group of other passionate misfits to come together and solve problems! And find a way to the finish line- one way or another!

Today, I’m tackling the biggest problem I've ever taken on—fixing ad targeting with GoAudience.

For the last 3 years, since Apple ATT framework was released, Meta Ad targeting results has been all over the place, GoAudience is designed to solve this.

It enables performance marketers to move beyond traditional demographic targeting, leveraging advanced AI-powered insights to directly connect with the audiences that matter most.

By integrating credit card spending history of 220M consumers, GoAudience empowers brands and agencies to reduce customer acquisition costs by up to 57%.

I’ve spent my career spearheading new initiatives—from launching analytics programs and go-to-market strategies to scaling operations across growing organizations. Through these experiences, I’ve learned that success in any complex space starts with enabling cross-functional collaboration and creating shared accountability.

That’s exactly why I founded Pay-i. We’re tackling one of the biggest shifts in tech today: managing the economics of Generative AI. Traditional FinOps tools aren’t built for the unpredictable costs, multi-modal workflows, and rapid innovation cycles of GenAI. Pay-i is the enterprise-grade FinOps platform that unites finance, product, and engineering teams to bring real-time visibility, granular cost attribution, and actionable ROI insights across every AI workflow. By turning variable AI expenses into measurable business value, we help organizations launch GenAI products faster and scale them confidently.

Above all, I believe in building solutions that empower teams and drive meaningful outcomes. Whether it’s mapping AI costs down to the penny or connecting product performance to top-line revenue, I’m excited to help businesses navigate the rapidly evolving GenAI economy—and come out ahead.

My name is Masa, and I appreciate your interest in connecting with me. As an experienced technology entrepreneur with a successful track record in Japan and the US.

Born in Indonesia and raised in Australia, I furthered my studies with a Bachelor's degree in Tokyo, Japan, followed by a Master's degree in Bangkok, Thailand. My career commenced in IT consulting, catering to reputable financial clients including Goldman Sachs, Lehman Brothers, and Citi Bank. In 2008, I joined my first startup, which was subsequently acquired by Shogakukan, a leading Japanese publisher, in 2010.

My tenure at Rakuten began in 2010, where I led the business incubation division, successfully forging alliances with startups from the UK, Korea, and the US. In 2014, I transitioned to Recruit Holdings' Venture Capital Division as a Vice President, managing investments ranging from 200K USD to 5M USD. My portfolio includes 14 investments and two mergers and acquisitions.

Following my departure from Recruit, I have since established three companies in the IT BtoC market, each acquired by different Japanese companies.

Currently, I am the founder/CEO of DFA Robotics Inc., Japan's largest robotics company as of April 2023. At DFA, we are pioneering the world's first robot delivery system. You can find more information about us at https://dfarobotics.com. I have sold DFA to Change Inc. a, Japanese prime listed company in 2022 and now the chairman of DFA as well as running my new AI startup Marvis Inc. 

In addition, as an Angel investor, I have contributed to the growth of two remarkable companies: Keelys and Mojjo Japan. Keelys offers innovative automated office solutions and can be explored further at https://keeyls.com/. 
Mojjo Japan, on the other hand, uses AI to revolutionize the tennis industry; their innovative approach can be seen at https://www.mojjojapan.com/.

To streamline our potential collaboration, I kindly request you follow these guidelines:

Paxton,Active,Dr. Tanguy Chau,Founder & CEO @Paxton | Making legal work 10x efficient with AI | MIT PhD | Forbes Tech Council | Engineering + Law + AI,https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanguychau,"Palo Alto, California, United States","I'm building AI that makes lawyers 10x more efficient. Here's why:

As a VC at Formation 8, I invested early in companies like Ironclad that transformed legal operations. One pattern became clear: the most successful firms were using technology to amplify their lawyers' capabilities, not replace them.

This insight led me to found Paxton AI, where we're solving one of law's biggest challenges: making legal research faster and more accurate. Our platform recently achieved 94% accuracy on Stanford's Legal Hallucination Benchmark, setting a new standard for reliable AI in law.

My journey from MIT (PhD, Engineering) to legal tech wasn't obvious. But combining engineering precision with legal complexity is exactly what's needed to build trustworthy AI for lawyers.

Currently helping law firms:
• Cut research time by 70%
• Expand into new practice areas
• Maintain 100% citation accuracy
• Scale operations efficiently

Propense.ai,Active,Nnamdi Anyanwu,“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.”,https://www.linkedin.com/in/nnamdianyanwu,"Dallas, Texas, United States","I like learning. A lot.
What I enjoy even more are opportunities to apply what I've learned and watch my work manifest into tangible, measurable results.

My IT career began as Co-founder of a student-ran start-up at Rutgers University that focused on providing fellow students with premium study materials. That's where I learned to effectively prioritize tasks, be flexible, and take ownership of situations. The experience taught me about business and stress, but most of all, it taught me how to view situations from the vantage points of all parties involved. I'd define “urgency” after assessing the needs of the customer, my team, and the overall business, and only then react. I became comfortable with the notion that priorities can change swiftly and that it's necessary to think on my feet in order to keep up.

Since then I've accumulated a decade of enterprise IT experience and have seen rapid progression of responsibilities at work and in my technical skill.

I've fed my curiosity and passion for technology by building fundamental knowledge in a wide breadth of technical domains. I've utilized self-study [outside of working hours], with certification as a framework, to structure my learning pursuits. After getting exposure to multiple facets of IT, I've discovered my interest for Cloud Computing. From previous positions I've also discovered how important process improvement can be and that the time spent on it brings unmeasurable value to the organization. I believe employees should have the power to improve and automate processes, or champion new ways of doing things if the existing process is resistant to automation. As such, I've brought both interests together by diving into the realms of DevOps and Linux systems in the Cloud.

Next, I plan to transition from operations to software development.

Resume Highlights:
AWS Certified DevOps Engineer | LPIC-1 | Linux+ 
Programming & Configuration Management
Effective two-way communication. Self-motivated

Next Goals:
AWS Certified Database - Specialty
Improve Golang and Python programming proficiency

I am known for taking risks and for breaking down complex topics so they can be effectively communicated to audiences on big and small stages.  My unique process of research, analytics, brainstorming, testing, and publishing theories has allowed me to predict emerging trends well ahead of early market adoption.  I have developed a skill of market prediction and lead teams that keep a watchful eye to the bottom line while simultaneously fixing a gaze on the horizon line.

But I hit the same wall too many times: Being technical enough to want better answers from data, but not technical enough to get them without help.

So I built what I wish I’d had earlier.

Today at Fabi, we help technical business-side operators—like founders, PMs, and early data leads—explore their data faster, ask sharper questions, and make smarter decisions without spinning up a bloated BI stack. By helping them self-serve the first 80%, we free up your data team to focus on the 20% that really moves the needle.

If you’re building your first data stack, trying to understand what’s working, or just tired of flying blind, I want to help you move faster and more confidently. 

My perspective blends product thinking, real-world analytics experience, and a deep belief that data exploration shouldn’t only be accessible to experts. It should be part of how teams work from day one. I write about: 

-How AI supercharges data teams
-How PMs and founders can explore data safely and independently
-Building a data culture before you hire a data team
-Moving away from dashboard graveyards to integrated insights in your daily workflows
-Why curiosity—not just reporting—drives better questions and better decisions

You know …

- Using Newspaper Ads
- Purchasing Billboard Ads
- Waiting On Referrals
- Networking, etc...

The raw reality is if you continue down this path, it will only end in struggle and despair.

Treading water to stay afloat.

I don’t say this to be ‘pessimistic’ … I say this to inform you and help you evolve.

Charles Darwin once said: “It’s not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent who survives, but the ones most adaptable to change.”

Yes, using newspaper ads can be great. Yes, you can buy advertising space on billboards, wait on referrals, and yes, you can even network 24/7... all of which will get results (to a degree)…

- BUT -

If those are your PRIMARY ways of acquiring clients for your business, you are seriously falling behind.

This industry isn’t changing; it’s already changed.

Never has it been SO EASY to generate new clients for your practice. The world is literally accessible at your fingertips!

I mean, the internet has changed everything for attorneys.

You can now EASILY & PREDICTABILITY generate new leads and clients each month by simply leveraging technology to set up the right Machines to do all the prospecting & heavy lifting FOR you.

And the number of people you or your office staff can message or talk to in a day will no longer be your playing field. The entire country is.

With the playing field wide open, you no longer have to fight with your competition! Instead, you’ll finally be at ease knowing you have new leads and clients flowing in daily who are interested in working with you RIGHT NOW.

And the best part?

The industry establishment hasn’t caught on…

So for the few in this new frontier, it’s created an entire valley of golden opportunities & competitive advantages to be exploited.

Lore,Active,Marc Lore,Serial Entrepreneur | Moonshot Seeker | Mission Driven Dad,https://www.linkedin.com/in/marclore,New York City Metropolitan Area,"As young as 4 years old, I always wanted to be a farmer, because they grow stuff from nothing. And while I didn’t become a farmer in the literal sense, my intrinsic desire to make things grow, whether that be a business or an individual’s career, is still very much alive. In fact, this, combined with a desire to take risks and to push things where they’ve never been before, is what fuels me.
 
I’m a serial entrepreneur who’s started and sold four companies. Most recently Jet.com, which sold to Walmart for $3.3 billion in 2016 and prior to that, Diapers.com/Quidsi which sold to Amazon in 2011 for $550 million.
 
As an entrepreneur, I’ve learned how to build a mission-driven culture, prioritize the customer value proposition, build great teams and empower them to move fast to get stuff done. I’m a mercenary turned missionary. Because of this, I’m passionate about helping other founders make sense of the startup world, because I know from experience it can be difficult to navigate.
 
On LinkedIn I write about things that are top of mind and lessons I’ve learned along the way – ranging from leadership and culture, to funding and scaling, and how companies both large and small can benefit from a startup mindset. I also host Startup Standup, a series where I mentor and advise female founders who are preparing to secure their first (or next!) round of institutional funding.

Singulr AI,Active,Shiv Agarwal,Builder & Entrepreneur,https://www.linkedin.com/in/agarwalshiv,United States,"I’ve always been drawn to the inflection points, those moments when technology outpaces structure, and businesses are left figuring out how to move forward with confidence.

That’s the space I’ve spent most of my career in. Building systems. Leading teams. Solving for scale. And time and again, I’ve seen the same pattern: early enthusiasm, fast adoption, and eventually… complexity that no one saw coming.

AI is that pattern, accelerated.

As enterprises rush to adopt LLMs, agents, and GenAI tools, the real questions are changing:
What’s in production and who owns it?
What data is flowing through these systems, and where is it going?
Are we duplicating efforts across teams, or compounding risk?
Do we still have control, or is it just an illusion?

That’s why we built Singulr AI to bring visibility and governance back into the equation.

We’re building the missing layer of visibility and governance for enterprise AI. This control plane provides CIOs, CISOs, and technology leaders with the clarity they need to enable safe and strategic adoption. It’s not about slowing down innovation. It’s about removing the blind spots that turn innovation into risk.

My role as a founder is to build for what’s ahead, solving the infrastructure problems that will define whether AI becomes a true advantage or another unmanaged sprawl.

Outmarket AI,Active,Vishal Sankhla,Founder | Helping Insurance Leaders Drive Revenue & Efficiency with AI.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/vishalsankhla,United States,"Co-Founder & CEO | AI & Insurtech Innovator | Solving Complex Problems with Data & Automation

For centuries, insurance has been the backbone of commerce, yet it remains one of the most inefficient, fragmented industries. Manual workflows, siloed data, and outdated processes cost brokers and carriers billions in lost productivity each year.

I’ve spent my career solving these types of challenges at scale, whether it was optimizing petabytes of data at Uber, driving billions in revenue impact through ads optimization at Meta, or leading both consumer and enterprise product teams at Ethos, helping scale the business to a massive, profitable run rate. Each of these experiences deepened my passion for building intelligent, automated systems that replace inefficiency with speed, clarity, and action.

That’s why Anshu Jain and I co-founded Outmarket AI—the Intelligence Layer for Commercial Insurance.

🔹 The Future of Insurance: AI-Driven Automation
Commercial insurance is an $800B industry, yet brokers and underwriters are buried in manual processes, PDFs, and fragmented data. We’re changing that. Outmarket AI is not just digitizing insurance, it’s making it intelligent.

Imagine AI-powered agents that:

✅ Understand risk & carrier appetite across thousands of sources in real time
✅ Auto-generate submissions by pulling in all necessary data across emails, AMS, and PDFs
✅ Surface growth & cross-sell opportunities before brokers even need to look for them
✅ Automate underwriting & policy reviews, turning multi-day processes into minutes
✅ Streamline quote comparison by extracting key details from carrier emails, portals, and PDFs for side-by-side evaluation
✅ Analyze book of business trends to proactively flag retention risks and renewal opportunities
✅ Automate compliance and documentation checks, ensuring policies meet regulatory and underwriting standards

This isn’t a vision of the future, it’s what we’re building today at Outmarket with a stellar team that comes from Meta, Uber, Adobe and IBM.

🔹 Why This Matters
I've seen firsthand how data fragmentation, inefficient workflows, and misalignment hold industries back. 

At Outmarket, we’re solving these problems at scale—creating a world where brokers, underwriters, and carriers are empowered by AI, not burdened by data.

💡 If you're interested in shaping the future of insurance, let’s connect. Always open to conversations about AI, automation, and industry transformation.

From there, I helped establish the Agency’s first Data Management Office, ultimately serving as Chief Data Architect and laying the foundation for enterprise-scale data governance and infrastructure.

In 2015, I co-founded NU Borders with Tim Gildea—a software engineering and data science company focused on modernizing investigative tools for federal agencies. Our team supported mission-critical programs across DOJ, DHS, DoD, and the IC, with a focus on mapping and monitoring global supply chains and illicit networks through advanced data analytics.

Still, I always felt drawn to the product space—building tools that scale, and making transformative technology more accessible. That’s why I launched BITE Data with Anne Riitho: to bring AI-driven innovation to the world of trade compliance. At BITE, we're on a mission to disrupt the space with tools that empower procurement and compliance teams to:

- Uncover optimized tariffs
- Rapidly identify regulatory risks across supplier networks
- Pivot faster with smarter product data for sourcing teams

Excited to keep pushing boundaries at the intersection of data, regulation, and AI.",40,,"CEO, Co-Founder BITE Data",BITE Data · Full-time,Advisor -  Athstat Gaming,Athstat,"CEO, Co-Founder",NU Borders LLC,Duke University,"Master’s Degree, Engineering/Industrial Management",Florida Institute of Technology,"Bachelor’s Degree, Mechanical Engineering",Technical Architecture,Data Analysis,Big Data Analytics,Data Architecture,Data Warehouse Architecture,4,ICE Director’s Award; DHS S&T Under Secretary’s Award,"Presentation at Forced Labor Prevention Task Force meeting, December 18, 2024; Speaking at Trade Compliance Executive's Driving Trade Compliance event",,7.0,positive,,,,"Founded NU Borders LLC, a successful software engineering, data science and consulting company focused on trade compliance and national security; Built the BITE platform, a flagship tool for the trade community; Received ICE Director’s Award; Received DHS S&T Under Secretary’s Award",L4,"Thariq Kara demonstrates proven operational experience with multiple ventures and significant government leadership roles.

Today, I have the privilege of serving as President & CEO of Central Health, the public hospital district for Travis County, Texas. We care for people who are too often left out—those living on low incomes, navigating complex health challenges, or struggling to access basic services. For us, this work is deeply personal. It’s about trust. And trust is built one conversation, one clinic, one breakthrough at a time.

At Central Health, we’re building a fully integrated, taxpayer-funded health system that puts people first. That includes our health plan, Sendero, our partner CommUnityCare Health Centers, and a network of 400+ local organizations. Together, we’re working to close a 10–20 year life expectancy gap between neighborhoods east and west of I-35—disparities that cost our community more than $1.1 billion each year. 

Between 2024 and 2030, we’re investing over $800 million to bring care closer to where people live, improve outcomes, and transform how we serve. We believe health isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s one-size-fits-one.

Before joining Central Health, I served as the first System Chair of Medicine at One Brooklyn Health, uniting three hospitals to improve outcomes in some of New York’s most underserved communities. As the Chair of Medicine at Mass General Brigham Salem Hospital, I led our COVID-19 response, saving more than 2,100 lives and cutting the mortality rate to half the national average. My journey has also taken me to Rwanda and Liberia, where I helped strengthen health systems in post-conflict communities through values-based leadership and a focus on whole person care.

I trained at Princeton, UCSF, Mass General, Harvard Medical School, Kellogg Northwestern, and the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine—and have been honored by the CDC and HRSA for leadership in primary care and health systems transformation.

I am a builder at heart. I have served as an executive leading product and engineering teams in creating operating systems, video games, virtual reality, and cloud services for the consumer (B2C) and businesses (B2B) customers. The products I have helped create are used by billions of customers and have cumulatively generated 10s of billions of USD value. I enjoy driving a culture of driving results for customers, first principles thinking, and empowering the builders to do their best work. 

Most recently, I was the Chief Product/Technology Officer at Skillz (SKLZ), leading the product and engineering teams to improve revenue through Machine Learning optimization and new features and launching cloud gaming. I also recruited several executives to join Skillz including CTO and multiple Vice Presidents. 

Before Skillz, I was General Manager at Amazon Web Services, leading several technology teams in gaming, 3D, and edge applications. My teams launched the Open 3D engine initiative, three new cloud services for building and scaling 3D simulations and games. 

Prior to AWS, I was part of the product management team at Facebook, which launched the industry’s first consumer Virtual Reality platform, Oculus. I led the creation of an Oculus App Store ($1.5B in cumulative revenues), content publishing services, and platform growth teams. Before that, I was a General Manager leading product and engineering teams in online dating and video games ($150M+ ARR).

Dextego Inc,Active,Ioanna Mantzouridou Onasi,Influence Drives Outcomes I Co-founder & CEO @ Dextego I AI Coaching for Sales & Leadership I Award Winning Speaker I Creator of the BRIDGE Framework,https://www.linkedin.com/in/joannemantzouridou,"Queens, New York, United States","Sales enablement isn’t broken because people lack tools or processes. It’s broken because most companies overlook the one skill that truly drives outcomes: influence.

Before co-founding Dextego, I led global enablement across sales, customer success, and learning systems at a Fast 100 AI scaleup. Time and again, I saw the same pattern: teams trained on products and playbooks but left without the coaching to master the power skills that actually move people communication, trust, presence, adaptability.

Influence is behind every win. Yet it’s rarely developed in a meaningful, practical, scalable way. Most enablement stops at knowledge transfer. The impact stops there too. That gap inspired Dextego.

Dextego’s AI Coaching Platform, powered by EQ and human psychology, helps sellers and managers build the skills that shape influence and drive results. Through adaptive coaching, roleplays, and feedback, we turn soft skills into competitive advantage.

You can try Dextego for free and see how our AI Coaches help your teams grow. → dextego.com

My background blends psychology, strategic management, talent development, and rhetoric, an uncommon mix that’s shaped how I think about performance and potential. I began studying talent in grad school and launched my first company as a teenager in the sustainable fashion industry. I’ve since had the privilege of speaking on global stages, mentoring founders and students, and contributing to how the next generation learns and leads.

I’ve spoken on global stages, mentored across generations, and received recognition like TiE NJ GRIT Award 2025, Transform Top 10 Leaders Finalists 2025, SalesIntel Top 300 Women in SaaS 2025, 50 Female Founders to Have on Your Radar 2025, Education 2.0 Young Leader Award 2024, FACC Cross-Cultural Educator Award 2024, Top 100 Entrepreneur & Innovator 2024. What drives me is helping individuals and teams reach their potential through tech that’s intelligent, human-centered, and practical.

Today, I work with forward-thinking leaders who believe coaching should be proactive, not reactive and that power skills are more important than ever in the AI era.

Coachability isn’t just a mindset => It’s a measurable skill.
Power skills, such as influence, trust, presence and aren’t “nice-to-have.” => They’re your competitive edge.
Call data isn’t coaching. => Context and feedback are what drive change.
Leadership isn’t born. => It’s built through deliberate practice, iteration, and reflection.

Let’s connect if you’re building a sales culture that’s human-centered, AI-enabled, and outcome-driven.",27,,Co-Founder & CEO of Dextego,Dextego,Founding Member,La Creme de la STEM™ - female founders support system,Member of Young Executives Committee,French-American Chamber of Commerce - New York,Pace University,"Master of Science - MS, Strategic Management",St. Lawrence University,"Bachelor of Science - BS, Psychology & Performance Communications Arts",Marketing,Client Onboarding,Training Delivery,Sales Enablement,Event Planning,4,Featured in The Top 100 Innovators & Entrepreneurs magazine,Aspire to Inspire Podcast on Gen Z Leadership and AI; YouTube interview on Dextego and AI-powered talent development,,7.0,positive,,,,"Co-founder and CEO of Dextego, an award-winning AI sales coaching startup; Recognized with the Outstanding Leadership Award at the Education 2.0 Conference, 2023; Finalist at the Transform Awards and recipient of Cool EdTech Award for Dextego; Co-author of 'Ed Metadores: Reinventing Education'; Featured in Top 100 Innovators & Entrepreneurs magazine",L2,"Based on the available information, this founder fits the L2 (Early-Stage Entrepreneur) profile.

Brightband,Active,Daniel Rothenberg,Building the next generation of AI technologies for improving weather and climate prediction.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/rothenbergdaniel,"Erie, Colorado, United States","I'm passionate about leveraging advanced, contemporary technologies to better solve classic and critical problems in meteorology and climate science.

Recently at Waymo I tackled broad weather and environmental challenges which impact autonomous vehicles. As a Technical Lead I worked horizontally across the engineering organization to understand weather-related problems, and to plan and push solutions to them in order to unblock the company's critical path towards its key product milestones for Waymo One and Waymo Via. 

In my previous role as the Chief Scientist at Tomorrow.io, I led a team of scientists and engineers to tackle challenging problems at the interface of meteorology, data science, and software engineering. We developed and productionized new systems and techniques for integrating novel, micro-weather observations into large-scale diagnostic systems which provide critical ""weather intelligence"" for our clients. We also brought to operational life new forecasting and analysis techniques leveraging the cloud and big data technologies. As an officer of the company I also contributed to strategic planning and decision-making. 

Prior to leaving academia, I was a research assistant and then post-doctoral scholar at the Center for Global Change Science and Institute for Data, Systems and Society at MIT. My research focused on the complex interactions between weather, climate, air quality, and human health. To accomplish this, I applied both statistical and dynamical models of  the chemistry-climate system to understand how climate shapes air quality by influencing regional weather patterns and variability. I use these models to understand how climate change may perturb these relationships, producing poor air quality more frequently. With my group, we can then assess how this would impact human health, the economy, and ultimately feedback on climate change itself. 

Beyond my primary research and professional roles, I am interested in the continued development of global, crowd-sourced weather observation networks which might bolster numerical weather prediction and foster a weather-aware/savvy society, as well as resolving fundamental issues in climate science, in particular the role of aerosol interactions with clouds in the context of climate change. Furthermore, I am strongly involved in work at the interface of science and policy in sustaining the ""innovation pipeline"", and keenly interested in workforce challenges and opportunities that AI bring to the weather enterprise.",36,,"Co-Founder, Head of Data and Weather",Brightband · Full-time,Staff Software Engineer (Bungee),Google · Contract,"Staff SWE / Technical Lead, Atmospheric Science",Waymo · Full-time,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Ph.D., Atmospheric Science",Cornell University,"BS, magna cum laude, honors distinction in research, Atmospheric Science",Fortran,Science,Algorithms,Python,NumPy,3,,Contributor to AI and weather forecasting discussions; Involved in open-source AI weather forecasting initiatives,0,7.0,positive,,,,"Earned BS in Economics from Harvard University; Career progression through major financial firms Morgan Stanley, UBS, and RBC Wealth Management; Active involvement and leadership in multiple community and advisory boards",L3,"Daniel Rothenberg demonstrates strong technical and scientific credentials with significant experience at notable companies, fitting the L3 'Technical and Management Veterans' profile.

More recently, I held the position of Executive Vice President (EVP) and Chief Innovation Officer (CINO) at FIS (NYSE: FIS), where I co-founded and built a corporate venture builder, FIS Impact Labs.

I believe IT leaders shouldn't have to choose between modernizing their infrastructure and maintaining reliable print services. That's why we're leading the PrintOps category: the modern, cloud-native approach to print infrastructure that helps large enterprises finally complete their cloud transformation journey.

Throughout my career, I've focused on understanding how technology impacts people and organizations. First as founder of Loud Dog, helping companies build digital products and brands. Then as an Operating Partner partnering with startups and enterprises to drive innovation and improve operations. Now at Pharos, I'm combining that experience to help IT leaders solve one of their most persistent challenges.

- Digital employee experience (DEX) optimization
- Print infrastructure innovation through PrintOps
- Technology strategy and digital transformation
- Building high-performing teams and cultures

Not just the shiny, new gadgets (though those are great, too)—I love how tech empowers people, transforms businesses, and redefines what's possible. I’ve built my career around that mission: turning complex innovation into real-world impact.

Today, I’m the CEO and Co-Founder of Apolo.us, a next-gen AI infrastructure platform built for data centers, telcos, and enterprises. We’re building the GPU hub—and orchestration layer—that powers efficient, secure, multi-tenant AI development at scale.

But my journey here? It's been a blast:

🔹 I started as a systems consultant, figuring out how tech really connects to business outcomes.
🔹 At World Wide Fittings, I built a global IT department from the ground up.
🔹 At MTM Technologies, I climbed the ranks from architect to CTO—shaping cloud, VDI, and digital workplace strategies for enterprise clients across the country.
🔹 At EPAM, I dove head-first into bleeding-edge innovation—AI, ML, RPA, DevOps, you name it.
🔹 At Switch, I worked with some of the smartest minds in data centers and hyperscale, helping define the digital infrastructure of tomorrow.

And now? I’m laser-focused on solving the biggest challenge facing modern infrastructure: making AI real, accessible, and manageable—without compromise.

When I’m not leading a startup or writing about the future of AI and data centers, you’ll find me:

- Advising emerging startups and enterprise execs
- Speaking at conferences (sometimes in multiple time zones per week)
- Writing about data centers, GPUs, infrastructure, and the occasional robot
- Teaching and mentoring the next generation of tech leaders
- Or chasing caffeine (not that I really need it) with my two kids and wonderful wife, Linda

I believe in making technology approachable. I believe in building responsibly. And I believe that if we do this right, AI won’t just be powerful—it’ll be transformational.

If you're building something bold in AI, cloud, data centers, or digital infrastructure—let’s connect.

This early passion led me down an entrepreneurial path where I discovered that the most meaningful innovations often emerge from witnessing real problems firsthand.

In March 2023, this belief was put to the test. As dozens of startups scrambled to move their money during the SVB collapse, I found myself working around the clock helping companies navigate the crisis. The experience exposed a critical vulnerability in our financial system - loan covenants and complex credit arrangements were creating unexpected roadblocks, revealing just how opaque and inefficient lending risk assessment had become.

Intrigued by these challenges, I began a journey of discovery with my future co-founders, speaking to dozens of lenders to understand their struggles with risk analysis and monitoring. What we uncovered was striking: most lenders were stuck using manual processes to assess complex credit risks, often reviewing their portfolios just 2-4 times per year. With private credit markets now exceeding $2.1 trillion, this approach wasn't just inefficient—it was becoming dangerous.

These insights led me to co-found EnFi with Scott Weller and Michelle Hipwood, leveraging our combined experience to revolutionize credit risk assessment. It's the latest chapter in my journey of building and scaling companies, following successful exits including the acquisition of clypd by AT&T and WHERE by PayPal. Each venture has taught me that great companies aren't just about innovative products - they're about creating environments where exceptional people want to work.

When I'm not working on EnFi, I'm usually mentoring other entrepreneurs or spending time with my wife Rachel and our children, Parker and Alisha. I'm also deeply committed to giving back to the startup ecosystem as co-founder of TBD Angels, which has grown to 300 members and invested in 80+ startups.

I believe the best innovations come from combining technical excellence with human insight. Whether you're interested in the future of lending, passionate about AI innovation, or simply looking to connect about building companies that matter, I'd love to hear your story. After all, the most exciting chapters in entrepreneurship often begin with a simple conversation.",48,,Co-Founder and CEO,"EnFi, Inc · Full-time",Co-Founder,TBD Angels,Board Member,Mable,Carnegie Mellon University,"BS, Industrial Management, Additional Major in Economics",,,Corporate Fundraising,Start-up Ventures,Financial Services,Retail,Mobile Advertising,12,,Podcast episode on 'Right Here in Mass' discussing entrepreneurial journey and company vision; Featured in Blue Dun interview '20 Questions with Joshua Summers'; Speaker on AI-powered culture of innovation and collaboration at AMANET,0,7.0,positive,,,,,L7,"Joshua Summers demonstrates a clear pattern of successful serial entrepreneurship with multiple verified exits to major companies (AT&T and PayPal).

My passion lies at the intersection of AI, finance, and automation, helping redefine how businesses leverage intelligent systems to drive efficiency and innovation.

Before EnFi, I co-founded and served as CTO of SessionM, a data and marketing platform used by the world’s largest brands. SessionM was acquired by Mastercard in 2019, where I continued as GM and Head of Product for the Merchant Loyalty division.

My journey into tech started early—I was raised on a farm and homeschooled until college, which gave me the freedom to dive into technology at a young age. At 16, I joined Intelecom Data Systems, one of the country’s first ISPs, working alongside early internet pioneers. Over the years, I’ve played key roles in multiple startups, including Gamesville (acquired for $218M) and Lycos (acquired for $12.5B), and have led technology teams at Telefónica’s Terra Networks, Scientific Games, and Mastercard.

Beyond building companies, I’ve spent the last decade investing in and mentoring over 45 startups in the Boston and New England ecosystem, helping first-time founders navigate funding, team-building, product development, and go-to-market strategy.

Creo,Active,Roman Markelov,CEO @ Creo Networks Inc.,https://www.linkedin.com/in/markelxv,"San Francisco, California, United States","Roman Markelov is a tech entrepreneur, investor, and founder of Creo, a next-generation social network built to empower creators, protect freedom of speech, and redefine the global digital economy. His vision challenges the traditional advertising-driven model, shifting financial power from corporations to individuals and ensuring that those who fuel engagement are the ones who benefit.

Before founding Creo, he worked in marketing, product design, and venture capital, leading large-scale growth strategies and projects generating hundreds of millions in revenue. As CEO of Markelov Agency, he led advertising and monetization campaigns for global brands. Later, he founded Markelov Ventures, focusing on investments in e-commerce, media, and artificial intelligence. He also contributed to a $700M investment fund, evaluating and supporting early-stage tech companies.

As a Russian citizen, his path changed in 2022 when, after publicly speaking out against the war in Ukraine, he was forced into exile, losing all assets, including venture capital investments. Over the next two years, he lived in Turkey and Mexico, conducting technical research while experiencing homelessness on the beaches of Tijuana. During this time, he reimagined the future of social media — not just as entertainment but as a creator-driven financial ecosystem, ensuring fair monetization, data privacy, and user ownership.

Creo was developed as an alternative to the corporate-controlled advertising economy, where billions are extracted from creators and redistributed to platform shareholders. Instead, Creo offers direct monetization, letting creators profit from their content without intermediaries. Under Roman Markelov’s leadership, Creo is positioned as a direct competitor to Meta and Mark Zuckerberg, aiming to dismantle their monopoly over digital engagement.

Markelov’s vision extends beyond monetization — it is about fundamentally restructuring digital platforms. He envisions a future where creators have financial independence, their data is protected, and their voices are not controlled by centralized entities. Through Creo, he is not just building a platform — he is creating a new digital economy, where content creators own their audience, their revenue, and their future.

From political exile and homelessness to leading a San Francisco company poised to reshape the global advertising industry, Roman Markelov’s journey represents a fight for economic freedom, digital sovereignty, and the empowerment of creators worldwide.",24,,Chief Executive Officer,Creo Networks Inc. · Full-time,Markelov Ventures,4 yrs 9 mos,,,,,,,Venture Capital,Product Design,Business Analysis,Marketing,,0,,,0,0.0,neutral,,,,,L2,"Based on available information, Roman Markelov appears to be an early-stage entrepreneur with some prior business experience but limited verifiable startup success metrics.

Butterfly was born from a simple belief: frontline managers are one of the most critical, yet underserved, levers of organizational performance. Our platform turns feedback into a habit and leadership into a daily practice.

Before launching Butterfly, I built a career at the intersection of brand, digital, and product.

Before that, he was an Operating Partner at Sterling Partners and led the incubator to launch 4 companies in 4 years.

Very passionate about startups, scaling them up, and delivering superfast growth - blitzscaling. The idea of building a brand from scratch and setting the vision and strategy excites me like nothing else. Have good entrepreneurial experience heading business units and full ownership of P&Ls.

In my entire professional career, I have worked for bootstrapped and well-funded startups, did my own startup, was part of a large PSU, built teams, raised funds, struggled to raise funds, saw shutdowns, did layoffs, experienced acquisitions & acqui-hires, did angel investments and many more. These experiences have not only taught me responsibility, courage, and strength but also made me recognize my weaknesses and shortcomings.

Was part of 7 companies and 6 startups to date:
1. Hindustan Aeronautics - A big PSU. The startup bug bit me here.
2. TopTalent - Joined this startup by a fellow bitsian. First startup and a lot of learnings.
3. 1Click.io - First B2B / SaaS startup experience. A very short stint though.
4. MyWash - My first entrepreneurial venture. A true roller coaster ride. 
5. Housejoy - Acquired my startup MyWash. Series-B funded. First experience of working for a highly funded startup.
6. Fuelfill.in - Back to my comfort zone = early-stage startup. 
7. Shuttl - Series D funded startup. Promoted from city head to a Regional head.

Have solid experience in operations, supply chain management, creation and execution of ATL and BTL marketing campaigns across media types for branding, acquisition, retention or engagement objectives. Has an analytical bent of mind with a sharp eye for numbers. Very experimental by nature and open to new ideas and learning and always up for super challenging assignments.

He's currently Founder & CEO of Prophetic, a SaaS platform that helps developers find & analyze development opportunities in seconds, not hours. 

Oliver’s entrepreneurial journey started at an early age. From selling blackberries at the farmers market to finding old cars for collectors, Oliver has always found joy in business. As Co-Founder and Co-Executive Director of Orchid Health, Oliver spearheaded the business’ launch in 2014, including raising several rounds of angel and institutional investment, overseeing operations, budgeting, marketing, and employees. He also changed Oregon law via SB485 in 2017 which enabled Orchid to scale its model. Today, Orchid's team manages over 7,500 patient lives across its 6 locations. In 2021, Orchid was recognized as one of the state’s “100 Best Places to Work” by Oregon Magazine, while 2022 saw Orchid receive recognition as one of Oregon’s “Healthiest Employers” by the Portland Business Journal. 

Oliver’s next venture led him to commercial real estate, when he founded his second company Remote.ly in 2018. Remote.ly quickly grew to encompass 21k SF of Class-A office space in Portland, Oregon.  As the sole founder of Remote.ly, Oliver managed all aspects of the business as well as negotiated seven-figure leases, oversaw several TI build-outs, and shepherded the company through an absorption by a larger firm in December 2021.  

Oliver was recognized as a “40 Under Forty” award winner in 2020 by the Portland Business Journal and was a finalist for the 2016 Entrepreneurial Achievement Award. He’s been featured on the cover of Rural Roads magazine, was profiled in USA Today, and Medium’s “20-something Founder” series.

Revi,Active,Eugene Johnson,CEO at Revi,https://www.linkedin.com/in/eugenekjohnson1,"San Francisco, California, United States","Man of Faith- Husband - Father - Startup Founder - Investor - Author 

Eugene is the CEO of Revi which is a software platform that helps businesses increase revenue by leveraging consumer data & building relationships with everyone who buys from them, just like eCommerce sites do.  Revi elevates the consumer experience by digitizing their purchasing process, allowing them to build consumer profiles, personalize their experience & reward them through the purchase journey.  Revi’s vision is to become the Amazon of the physical space & become the way consumers desire to engage with businesses around them.

Eugene grew up in one of the toughest neighborhoods in NYC & often found himself caught up in the difficulties of living in an impoverished area. Though his circumstances were not ideal, he had dreams of taking his life to unprecedented heights.

While in college, Eugene started his first business at the age of 18. He built that business from the ground up starting with just him & eventually growing to hundreds of people nationwide. At 26, he sold a large stake in that business to a partner. Afterward, he traveled to places like Dubai & Africa to recharge. He then build an investment company that specialized in investing in options & Cryptocurrency. Over time many businesses asked for Eugene's advice so he build a consultancy helping leaders grow their organizations. As a consultant, he built his social media following to hundrends of thousands of followers & wrote a book that became an Amazon bestseller called ""The Mental Playbook.""

After spending time as a consultant, Eugene needed to get back into entrepreneurship, & he has always been fascinated with tech. However, with all Eugene's business experience, he thought it would be best to learn the tech space first beforehand. So he decided to work for a small (at the time) tech company called Meraki. Eugene ran sales for SMB/Mid Market companies across the west coast. That territory grew from one to seven states, & he increased revenue for his region by millions. Because of this, he gained recognition as one of the top sales executives at Meraki. Cisco eventually acquired Meraki for $1.5 Billion. Eugene spent almost five years there before he came up with the idea of Revi. Eugene is a high-energy leader who has an exciting approach to business and a desire is to build amazing businesses & products that impact the world. Eugene is that positive voice in your ear telling you to work hard, believe in yourself, & never quit. He lives by the slogan “Let no man steal your vision because no man gave it to you”",39,,CEO,Revi ,Leadership & Organizational Development ,Genisus Inc,CEO,Zyrl  · Full-time,The City College of New York,"Candidate for Bachelor of Arts, Double Major in Business Administration; Electrical Engineering ",,,Leadership,Sales,Entrepreneurship,Marketing,Training,5,,Motivational speaking and business development expertise in legal services and technology sectors; Sharing entrepreneurial journey and lessons learned to support young entrepreneurs,0,7.0,positive,,,,"Leading Collide Capital, a notable venture fund",L4,"Eugene Johnson demonstrates a track record as a proven operator with multiple business successes and significant sales leadership experience at Meraki (acquired by Cisco for $1.5B).

The Meraki experience particularly stands out as he scaled regional sales from one to seven states with significant revenue growth, positioning him as a top sales executive before the $1.5B Cisco acquisition. While impressive, his achievements don't yet reach L5+ territory as there's no evidence of >$50M funding rounds or unicorn-level companies founded personally.",0.60

Drillbit,Active,Alexander Seutin,"Founder @ Drillbit | YC | Stanford AI | Eng @ Rivian, Apple, SpaceX",https://www.linkedin.com/in/aseutin,"Austin, Texas, United States","The driving force throughout my career has been my goal to create an affordable and sustainable solution to housing development.

I started coding in 2011 - formalizing my education with a degree in CS and AI at Stanford University. After some time at SpaceX in 2018, I realized how poorly prepared we are to develop infrastructure from a distance. There is a true need for hands-off construction solutions - not only to help us explore the solar system, but to drastically cheapen housing on earth. Having grown up with housing insecurity, this really struck a chord with me.

That summer, I came up with a plan and made a commitment to learn as much as I could from the industry in the next phase of my career. My time at Apple showed me how successful large scale organizations operate. This exposure allowed me to take on more responsibility in my next role at Built Robotics where I was able to narrow my focus towards the intersection of technology and construction. As the company prepared to scale, I helped make key business and product decisions, bridging the mental gap between engineering and leadership.

In the summer of 2021, I decided it was time to get my hands dirty and work on housing directly. I would start with the most minimal solution: travel trailers. After several renovations, I moved on to a house in Austin, Texas. Over 6 months, I began to gain an appreciation for the skills and trades involved in real life solutions, further grounding my understanding of this industry and stepping out from behind the computer monitor to better understand what could be automated in the future.

Over the next couple of years, I would continue to take on more responsibility within the autonomous driving division at Rivian. This company produces some of the most tightly integrated and elegant vehicles on the market - with all the pieces needed to camp and live out of them. Not to mention, they are powered by a renewable energy source. But, once return to office went back into affect, it was time for me to go.

Now I am working on my own company to tackle housing affordability directly. As I continue on this journey, I hope to make a real impact on the future of autonomous infrastructure development for people in need and explorers alike.",33,,Founder & CEO,Drillbit · Full-time,Senior Software Engineer,Rivian · Full-time,Robotics Software Engineer,Built Robotics · Full-time,Stanford University,"Bachelor of Science - BS, Computer Science",International High School,"French Baccalaureate Diploma with Highest Honors, Science Track with Specialty in Mathematics",French,Critical Thinking,Objective-C,Teaching,Python,4,,Guest on The AI Playbook podcast discussing technology and construction,0,5.0,positive,,,,,L2,"Alexander Seutin demonstrates characteristics of an early-stage entrepreneur with strong technical background and prestigious work experience, but is currently on his first startup venture.

My co-founder Zack and I started Legible after seeing firsthand how much time government affairs professionals spend navigating scattered systems - state websites, spreadsheets, and inboxes - just to stay on top of legislation. These professionals shape policy outcomes every day, but the tools available haven’t kept up with the pace or complexity of their work. This struck me during my own work in policy, and I knew there had to be a better way. 

It turns out there wasn't...so we built it.

Legible is your personalized AI policy analyst. It tracks, filters, and flags legislation by state, client, and topic, so our users can skip the admin work and focus on strategy.

I've spent my career solving the disconnect between how B2B companies sell and how buyers want to buy.

At Salespeak, we've built an AI Sales Brain that engages website visitors in intelligent, buyer-centric conversations they actually want to have - no more forcing them to talk to sales reps who don't understand their world.

The result? Our customers see 30%+ increases in qualified leads from their existing traffic, deeper insights into buyer needs, and more delighted customers who appreciate a self-directed buying experience.

Previously, I co-founded Totango and led GTM functions before a successful acquisition by a PE firm. That journey taught me the frustrations that both B2B buyers and sellers face in the traditional sales process - which inspired the creation of Salespeak.

Mario Colla founded Tiendamia.com in 2015. I joined him a few months later, initially as COO and later as CEO. Since then, the company grew to become one of the largest eCommerce platforms in Latin America and the absolute leader in cross-border eCommerce.

Even though we managed to raise $20 million dollars in 2021 from Cartesian Capital, our path was not an easy one. For most of our journey since the company was funded, VCs regarded ""eCommerce"" as a bad industry. They feared the Amazon factor, and believed eCommerce was a winner-takes-all industry with a pre-defined winner.  

We relied mostly on bootstrapping for growth, and learned to be resourceful and work hard to achieve our goals. More than anything, we believed that if we built the best cross-border ecommerce team in the world, we would succeed. 

Today, Tiendamia is one of the few Latin America tech startups that reached critical mass while remaining profitable. 

I stepped down as CEO in July 2022 and now serve as a Board Member and Advisor for the company. Tiendamia currently operates 10 markets in Central and South America. I am now starting a new company in the AI sector (currently in stealth mode).

No agency grad schemes, no advertising school pedigree; just an obsession with how words move people (and a refusal to write like a robot).

Along the way, I’ve developed a bit of a superpower: helping brands not only enforce their brand voice but also appear in Google as well as AI-powered search engines and tools (think ChatGPT, Perplexity, or Gemini). 

Today, I'm either taking on cool copywriting gigs as a freelancer or working at my agency, decipher.

Querri,Active,Dave Ingram,Making data ridiculously easy,https://www.linkedin.com/in/daveaingram,"Charleston, South Carolina Metropolitan Area","One of the great feelings in life is sitting down in front of a blank whiteboard with a diverse group of great people, and figuring out how to solve a big and important problem.

I love the blank white board because in business, as in life, there are always fresh possibilities we haven’t come up with before. We will certainly go back and build on existing solutions, but the freedom and the courage to leave the old behind and pick up new skills, new technologies and new solutions in the face of a daunting problem is liberating and leads to the unexpected and to the most elegant solutions that I’ve seen.

I love working with a diverse group of great people, because we are always stronger together. All of our professional and life experiences lead to fresh perspectives. Conflict and disagreements chip away at the edges of our incomplete ideas, uncovering the truth that lies at the intersection of big ideas.

Walking away from the whiteboard, I love to find the gaps that aren’t being filled by others and help move a project forward quickly. Whether this is writing some data processing code, scoping out a new product, or creating a marketing video, I like to get my hands dirty and see things move along.

I draw heavily from Agile/Scrum in much that I do. I’ve seen some unsuccessful implementations of some of the tools, but when I’ve worked on teams that “get it”, it’s been magical. I could talk your ear off on a lot of pieces, but I think when the “core values” of commitment, focus, openness, respect and courage are in place in a team, then anything is possible.",29,,Founder,Querri · Full-time,Co-Founder,Charlestonhacks · Part-time,"Chapter President - Charleston, SC",VR AR Association,University of Florida,Political Science,,,Data Visualization,REST APIs,Large Language Models (LLM),Competitive Landscape,Analytical Skills,3,,Featured guest on CDC Tech Life Podcast episode 42 discussing Querri and Generative AI technology; Co-founder of CharlestonHacks to unite Charleston tech community through hackathons; Chapter President for the VR AR Association promoting virtual and augmented reality technologies,,6.0,positive,,,,Significant insider trading activity with multiple companies; Accumulated substantial shareholdings in multiple financial firms,L1,"Based on the available information, this appears to be a first-time founder with limited verifiable entrepreneurial track record.

We started by teaming up with Porsche to build an AI engine capable of surfacing high-leverage insights across development, production, and field operations. Since then, we’ve expanded to support companies across industries as they detect failure patterns, reduce costs, and accelerate iteration cycles.

Our model is hands-on: we embed experts alongside clients, build custom tools, and integrate directly into core workflows. The result is smarter strategy, software, and outcomes—delivered through a tight blend of platform + partnership. Better machines. Built faster with AI.

Before Pull, I started and scaled multiple companies—all of which had successful exits, one venture-backed and two bootstrapped. I’ve built teams from scratch, launched products in competitive markets, and worn nearly every hat across technology and business.

Using that background I moved into architecting and operating network infrastructures and business software applications for Federal customers culminating in running a business unit to deliver engineering services.  

I then joined my father to build a company that provided comprehensive Cyber and Network Engineering for highly secure government networks.  I created a high-growth company as the CEO, exiting to a strategic buyer.  

I have since been providing strategic advice and board roles for startup, small, and mid-sized technology companies.  I am an expert at helping companies grow by creating values-based, accountable, high-performance organizations.  

My current role is CEO of Personam.ai, a Cybersecurity Software Company delivering an AI-driven autonomous network threat-hunting platform.  

Personam.ai, invented and patented in 2017, is an unsupervised artificial intelligence platform that autonomously hunts for cyber threats in network traffic. If it moves on a network, we catch it. The cyber threat landscape changes by the second as vulnerabilities are discovered, new tradecraft is developed, new attack vectors are developed, and new cyber criminal organizations emerge leaving security operations teams constantly behind and spending time tuning tools.

Personam.ai is the 24x7 always-on threat-hunting partner for your security operations teams – no changing configuration, no maintenance, no rule sets, no tuning — Just 100% accurate detection.  Our AI is custom trained to understand your network by watching how your network is used, changes, and grows.  Our patented detection approach, effective within hours of deployment, uses that deep understanding to determine what’s a threat and what’s just a change in how the network is used.  

Personam.ai is always learning - vigilant, adapting, and detecting known and emerging Cyber threats, keeping you ahead of the hackers.

I’m a serial founder who has spent the past 10+ years turning ambitious ideas into products that change how people work and learn.

EdTech: Co-founded pi-top, raised $30 million, and delivered award-winning STEM hardware and curricula used in 90+ countries.

AI & Workflow Automation: Today I’m CEO of Intellectible, an AI platform that converts complex, data-driven processes—grants, RFPs, investment memos, SOPs—into automated workflows and ready-to-use web apps. Early adopters include Federal contractors/ consultancies and leading education brands (e.g., MakerBot’s new AI teacher portal Makerbot-Nebula). Raised $2m to date.


What drives me
Leveling the playing field – Giving teams of any size the power to produce high-quality business critical outputs and decisions at enterprise speed.

Human-in-the-loop AI – Marrying transparent workflows with agents that can reason, iterate, and learn from source material, not just chat.

Scalable impact – Turning decades of tribal knowledge into digital assets that compound in value over time.

How I add value
Fundraising & product strategy (pre-seed to Series B)
Building and leading cross-disciplinary product teams
Translating messy, regulated workflows into secure, AI-native systems
Partnering with enterprises to prove ROI and unlock new revenue streams

Let’s connect
I’m always interested in swapping ideas with operators, investors, and innovators who see AI as a force-multiplier for complex work. Drop me a note if you’d like to explore partnerships, investment opportunities, or lessons learned on scaling AI products.

2016 is also the year of birth of the Lastminute Foundation, a foundation that has the aim of promoting cultural and technological innovation in a context of social solidarity and  he also founded Boost Heroes, a company that, with the help of its 40 members such as investors and business angels, invests in companies that have high potential but that are still in the first stages of their development.

My entrepreneurial spirit has led me to found three companies so far: Firebrand Innovations which sold videoconferencing IP, Codex Collective which produces electronic music events in Seattle, and most recently Soundry AI which provides an AI text-to-sample generator for music producers & songwriters.

Disputed.ai,Active,Olga V. Mack,CEO @ TermScout | Accelerating Revenue | AI-Certified Contracts | Trusted Terms,https://www.linkedin.com/in/olgamack,"San Francisco, California, United States","Hey there! I’m Olga, and my path here wasn’t exactly linear. If you’re looking for the kind of CEO bio that starts with “I’ve always known I’d…” well, this isn’t it.

Where It All Began

My journey began in Ukraine, where I dreamed of creating beautiful things. As a kid, I thought art school would be my next big step. But life had other plans—I moved to the San Francisco Bay Area at 13, a place I call “Candy Land” for its endless opportunities. Here, I discovered that tech can be beautiful, functional, and a powerful tool for change. That discovery shaped everything I do today.

The Spark

Today, I live and breathe at the intersection of law, technology, and impact. As a CEO, I’ve led a legal tech startup (which I sold to LexisNexis) and advised Fortune 100 companies and leading tech companies on how to innovate safely and law better. I’ve been privileged to work as a General Counsel, guiding companies through IPOs, acquisitions, and complex investigations. And along the way, I’ve taught at Berkeley Law, researched at Stanford Law, prosecuted cases as a San Francisco DA, written books, spoken at top conferences, and advocated for a future where law serves people—not just systems.

Why I’m Here

In a world that sometimes feels complicated and opaque, I believe we can make law simpler, fairer, and more accessible. The rule of law should be like electricity—there to support all of us without being cumbersome or costly.

My Mission

⚖️ Make Law Accessible – Using technology, we can make law a service for all. It doesn’t need to be expensive or intimidating. It can be clear, helpful, and humane.

🖼️ Design for Understanding – Legal concepts shouldn’t be a mystery. Through design and practical visuals, I want to make law a universal language everyone can understand.

💻 Modernize the Law – The legal system shouldn’t run like a clunky, outdated machine. With new tech, we can make it responsive, resilient, and built for the world we live in now.

Join Me on This Journey

Law doesn’t have to be a dated circuit board—it can be as simple and intuitive as flipping a switch. It can be empowering, fair, and even beautiful. If you’re ready to challenge how we law, let’s connect.",44,,Chief Executive Officer,TermScout,Co-Founder,"Better Parenting Plan, Inc.",Co-Founder,ESI Flow,"University of California, Berkeley - School of Law","J.D., Law","University of California, Berkeley","B.A., Economics & Political Science",Innovation, Thought Leadership,Law ,Labor and Employment Law,Corporate Governance,15,Silicon Valley Women of Influence; Make Your Mark; Corporate Counsel of the Year; Women Leaders in Technology Law; ABA Women in Legal Tech,TEDxSanFrancisco presentation on How Smart Contracts Will Change the World; Lecturer at Berkeley Law (Blockchain for Lawyers course); Host of Blockchain Value LinkedIn LIVE/podcast,12000,9.0,positive,,,,"CEO of Parley Pro, a next-generation contract management company pioneering digital negotiation technology; Co-founded SunLaw to prepare women in-house attorneys for leadership roles; Co-founded WISE to help female law firm partners become rainmakers; Author of multiple books including 'Get on Board: Earning Your Ticket to a Corporate Board Seat' and 'Fundamentals of Smart Contract Security'; Lecturer at Berkeley Law; Recipient of Silicon Valley Women of Influence, Make Your Mark, Corporate Counsel of the Year, and Women Leaders in Technology Law awards; Fellow of CodeX, Stanford Law Center for Legal Informatics, and College of Law Practice Management",L4,"Olga Mack demonstrates a proven track record as a successful operator with at least one exit and significant executive experience.

Data Analytics & AI will be the most significant lever to deliver the trifecta of enhanced efficiency, experience and revenue. But 70% of client investments in Data Analytics & AI will fail because of low adoption. 

Straive is a new category of strategic partner for clients looking to operationalize Data Analytics & AI. 

Straive is differentiated by four unique capabilities: 
+ Talent stack that spans Data Analytics & AI, Product Engineering to inject AI into workflows and Expert-In-Loop operations to facilitate change management
+ Easy-to-integrate industry and function-specific AI accelerators for speed to impact
+ Continuous Operationalization | Parallel Development implementation methodologies
+ Flexible commercial models that make AI operationalization viable

Before Straive, Ankor was part of the Executive Committee at EXL where he led the growth of EXL into an industry-leading Data Analytics & Digital Operations leader. Prior to that, he was a Partner at Inductis before EXL’s pre-IPO acquisition of Inductis in 2006.

I studied Physics and Computer Science at McGill University, and graduated with my Bachelor of Science in June 2019. I have deep interests in data visualization and software engineering.

As a native to Houston, Texas, the mechanics behind game-changing technology has always fascinated me. Throughout my university career, I had the opportunity to work at the NASA Johnson Space Center as an intern for Barrios Technology, building internal reporting tools, performing data migration and queries, and enabling automation. I also worked at Plotly as a software engineering intern, helping interface laboratory instruments from an analytical web framework and building marketing collateral for Dash, Plotly’s flagship product. Prior to my final year, I was at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a data science intern working on the visualization of high-dimensional cyber security data. 

Software is my forte; I am adept in Java, JavaScript, Python, SQL, and C. I perpetually challenge myself to new ideas, and am interested in leveraging and further solidifying my skills in software development.

My journey began with a 12-month beta inside Fitzgerald Auto Mall, culminating in a full production rollout that proved the model: AI-led sales can convert more, cost less, and work 24/7 without friction.

Today, I advise forward-thinking dealer principals and operational leaders on how to reduce sales friction, unify lead handling across rooftops, and future-proof their operations with actionable AI strategy.

My ideal clients:

• Private dealerships needing lower overhead + higher conversion

• Dealer groups navigating messy software/process sprawl post-acquisition

• Owners ready to harness AI but unclear where to start, or who to trust for clear, and honest recommendations. 

If you're seeking practical, revenue-aligned AI guidance, I help you build what works.

• Privately held dealers or groups with 3–50 rooftops

• Owners looking to modernize without vendor lock-in

• Sales/ops teams overwhelmed by legacy systems

• Companies unsure how to start with AI—or burned by generic solutions

She’s also pioneering the intersection of AI and authentic storytelling through My Story Pro, an AI-powered platform that she built with her online business manager turned co-founder that hit 5 figures MRR in less than 60 days, proving you CAN use AI with a ""human-first"" sentiment. 

Patrice helps entrepreneurs and industry leaders (including the product manager teams at Apple) maintain their distinctive voice while leveraging technology, combining decades of storytelling expertise with innovative AI tools in a unique ecosystem that includes a vibrant Circle community, live workshops, and hands-on coaching & consulting.

As an Emmy and Gracie Award-winning former TODAY Show producer, she learned from the best storytelling minds in the business. Whether unleashing fury at Usher on 49th ave while 8 months pregnant or embedding with moms helping Syrian refugees on Turkish shores, she saw firsthand how authentic stories move people to action.

After leaving at her career peak in 2016 for a toxic media startup (who gets money thrown at them on maternity leave?!), she found herself rebuilding from scratch. That rock-bottom moment led her to create a storytelling company helping visionary founders and businesses uncover stories that turn heads and open wallets.

She’s worked with brands from Netflix and Lululemon to startups like Parsley Health, but her real passion is helping founders who think they ‘don’t have a story’ discover their narrative gold. Because stories connect us with the human side of business in a way slick marketing never can.

Currently living in Lisbon with 3 small boys and her husband, she’s living proof that the stories we tell ourselves shape our reality. For years she would joke, ""I want to move to Europe"" and realized that it was possible.... if she told herself a different story.

We launched BlueMind, a compliance copilot for independent financial advisors. It simplifies regulatory tasks, automates KYC onboarding, and keeps advisors audit-ready without the overhead. The result? Advisors spend more time serving clients and less time wrestling with paperwork and regulatory fears. 

Now, I'm building Harmony — an enterprise-grade AI-powered compliance infrastructure for MGAs and large firms. Harmony is an invisible layer that sits on top of existing CRMs, quietly tracking advisor activity, flagging risks, and keeping leadership fully informed and compliant — all in real time.

What drives me:
 ✅ Helping firms turn compliance from a burden into a competitive advantage.
 ✅ Enabling advisors to deliver client-centric advice — with full confidence in their compliance. 
 ✅ Building technology that keeps pace with rapidly evolving regulatory demands.

These tools are timeless to provide a Blueprint to Wealth and create Financial Independence in 10-15 years and then pay it forward with those extra years to help solve the worlds hardest problems to build a better world for future generations.

💎 Blueprint to Wealth:
1. $0 - $10,000 - Education & Side Hustles: ROI on Education is everything at this stage and having a Side Hustle allows a person to make extra income, learn a new skill, and invest that savings into education for the next phase of wealth.
2. $10k - $100k - Skills & Savings: Learn a skill that aligns with your interests, quality of life, and risk profile that earns over $100k (ideally over $200k).
3. $100k - $1M - Investing/Business: Dual path depending on risk profile and skillset by either creating a business for 10-100X+ returns if successful and/or investing in BRRR, Duplex, 4-Plex, or House to subsidize housing expense to create savings rate of 30-40%+ for future investing in real estate or other asset classes.
4. $1M - $10M - Scaling: Scaling business from $100k-$1M EBITDA to $2-10M EBITDA and/or leveling up to apartment complexes from smaller properties or other value add asset classes for 15-20% IRR to accelerate wealth curve on path to $10M while maintaining 30-40% savings rate with high paying skill set.

While impressive, the scale and exit value (not publicly disclosed) likely don't reach L5 thresholds (>$50M funding/valuation). Their current venture Lyzr shows promise but is too early to factor into a higher classification. Multiple early entrepreneurial experiments (Bookmytees.com, Markorobo, Addopensa) show consistent founding experience, though without documented major outcomes.",0.68

Launched Everything AI --> It's Open Sea for AI tools. www.everythingai.club. 

Previously, I ran a performance marketing company: Growthspartan and a life skills platform: Masterlife. I like writing about business growth & personal growth. Surprisingly both in principle have a lot in common. 

The world is constantly signalling and it's getting extremely noisy. The only way to stand out today is to be you. 

To be the 1%, your actions, habits and thinking have to be like the 1%. Input metrics is all that matters. 

A quick highlight reel:

1) Did an Olympic triathlon in 2016. I wanted to do this before i turned 30 and was lucky to have a friend and an accountability partner for this.  

2) Graduated from Columbia University in 2012. Realized that i wasn't the smartest person in the room.

3) Climbed Stok Kangri (~20,000 ft) in 2017. Worth doing in your 20's if you're willing to rough it out. 

4) Wrote a book called Scale Smart in 2019. Book writing is one of the hardest things i've done. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone today. It's easier to start a podcast or create videos than write a book. It's sold more than 4,000+ copies. 

5) I lived in South America, SE Asia, Africa, US and Europe for quite a few years. Most people are fundamentally the same.  

6) I played basketball growing up. Played for college, university, state & was called for India camp. A lot of my identity comes from basketball. I was so lucky to play in a team and make friends that i am still in touch with today.
 
7) Being born into a happy family. My father was a pilot, my mom was an amazing teacher and my brother set the bar high growing up. They've taught me to have work hard, have fun, build good relationships and do things with high integrity.   

Outside of marketing, I like teaching, connecting with people, selling and creating new things. 

How we could work together:

1) Start paying for Lyzr :)
2) Advisory, Equity at AI startups. Can help with growth.
3) Check out AI tools at Everything AI
4) Need help with setting up teams, process, growth.

After a decade in AI research at Google DeepMind, something still deeply puzzled me: we spend 2.5 hours daily just moving our computer mouse. That's 30% of our work time on mechanical tasks.

This realization led me to build Simular AI. We're creating AI agents that use computers like humans do - clicking, typing, and navigating interfaces - so you can focus on what truly matters.

My journey spans:

- Research: 39 papers in top AI venues (NeurIPS, ICML, CVPR, ICLR)
- Engineering: Scaled AI systems at Google (Ads, Maps, YouTube)
- Leadership: Built & led teams in autonomous driving
- Competition: 2x World Finalist in ACM/ICPC

Now, I'm on a mission to democratize AI assistance. Because the future of work isn't about replacing humans - it's about augmenting them.

“But the guardrails were titanium-grade,"" your head of AI stammers.

""But we manually tested it against every prompt injection in our book,"" your security lead protests

You feel your stomach drop as you contemplate the inevitable board meetings, customer notifications, and potential regulatory investigations ahead.

Here's the reality: 89% of organizations are using or exploring LLMs, yet only 5% feel confident in securing them. AI security isn't optional anymore – it's essential.

To secure your AI systems without killing innovation, you need a strategy:

-> Identify the attack surface: AI systems face unique vulnerabilities - from prompt injection to training data poisoning.  Understanding where your AI systems are vulnerable is the first step to securing them.

-> Build security guardrails, intelligently: While it's tempting to lock down your AI systems completely, this can severely limit their functionality. The key is implementing smart boundaries - like input validation, output filtering, and runtime monitoring - that protects against attacks while preserving performance. 

-> Implement continuous AI red-teaming: Traditional penetration testing isn't enough for AI systems. You need ongoing adversarial testing that evolves with your models. This includes testing for data extraction, prompt injection, and model manipulation attempts. 


Attack is the best form of defense. So, we built Repello AI to help organizations secure their GenAI applications from an attacker's perspective. We've been fortunate to work with leading Fortune 500 companies and AI unicorns, helping them safeguard their AI applications.

Sold my last company in 2nd year at IIT Roorkee. Now, building Repello AI, backed by General Catalyst, pi Ventures and prominent angel investors from Silicon Valley.

Nodes,Active,Saad Bin Shafiq,Founder Nodes | First Full-Stack OS for Hiring Replacing Greenhouse and Workday ,https://www.linkedin.com/in/saad-bin-shafiq,"New York, New York, United States","I built my first product at 13 in a remote Himalayan village without electricity—a wooden drone made from scraps that flew 1 km. I self-taught myself to code at 16. Came to America on scholarship, studied maths and CS and started a growth agency where we scaled four companies from zero to $1M+ ARR each. 

But I kept seeing the same problem everywhere: broken hiring systems rejecting great candidates over missing keywords.

That's when I founded Nodes.

I started building AI agents in August 2023, before most people knew what they were. By end of 2024, I got a call from a Fortune 500 company. 

They had a problem: processing 1.5M applications annually with terrible results. I pivoted our entire platform in 2 weeks. 

What happened next changed everything:

→ Processed 135,000 candidates in 3 days for our first enterprise client (now we can do 10 M/day)
→ Achieved 70% faster hiring and 50% reduced turnover vs their old system
→ Contract signed 4 months early because results were ""too good""
→ $1.2M pilot became our foundation for an $12M active pipeline.

You see, AI will replace 12 million jobs by 2029.. When that happens, more people will flood the job market while outdated systems keep failing them. We're building the infrastructure to ensure talent finds opportunity, and opportunity finds talent, regardless of background.

While legacy recruiting platforms still use keyword matching from the dial-up internet era, we've built 78+ AI agents across 25 specialized layers that process entire digital footprints, predict cultural fit, and identify top performers with over 80% accuracy (case study available).

Our AI hunts for hidden talent, predicts retention, identifies flight risks, and creates custom training plans. 

We're the full-stack AI hiring operating system that makes incumbents obsolete.

We are a tech driven brokerage. I have over fifteen years of experience in residential and commercial real estate, helping  develop agents, Investing, building homes, and raising up leaders. I was recognized by the National Association of Realtors as one of the 30 Under 30 honorees in 2018.

Over the years of being immersed in the Real Estate industry I learned that something must be wrong when you have a failure rate of 87% . The image of the agent has been skewed over the years and perceived to be that of a ""used car salesman"" so I've been told. The value proposition of the the Real Estate Agent has changed due to increasing technology. It is a money driven industry that has put more focus on profit than it has on the people. 

After starting in a small brokerage where a lot of freedom was given to run my book of business how I wanted, to then switching to a larger ""big name"" Brokerage where they ran things in a more corporate manner. I realized that there needed to be a change in the industry, and with the help of some very talented individuals we can make that change. 

Out of a vision to the see the Real Estate industry change for the better, Modern Realty was born. We based the foundation of the company around the concept that we care more about people than profit. We believe that the top down approach is not for this generation, but instead we need to level the playing field. Our vision is to champion the Agent, so that he/she may champion the client. 

According the NAR reports 87% of all new agents fail after five years in the industry and only 13% make it. We believe that we can change that number. 

We believe in giving back. So much so, we have decided to build it into our very business model. We are excited to start this journey and I could not be more proud of the brokers and loyal clients that have helped us get this far.

My mission is to transform the real estate industry by putting people before profit, and by creating a culture of collaboration, empowerment, and service.",33,,Modern Realty,14 yrs 1 mo,CEO/Owner,Modern Property Management  · Full-time,30 UNDER 30 RECIPIENT ,National Association of REALTORS®,Portland Community College,"Bachelor's degree, Registered Nursing/Registered Nurse",Portland Community College,"Associate's degree, Fire Science/Fire-fighting",Theft Prevention,Law Enforcement,Organized Retail Crime Prevention,Short Sales,Foreclosures,2,2018 NAR recognition,Member of Business Journals Leadership Trust,,5.0,positive,,,,Built Modern Realty to a $175K/month firm; Successfully manages a team of real estate agents,L4,"The founder demonstrates proven operational experience in real estate with over 14 years of industry experience, having built a successful brokerage firm (Modern Realty) and receiving industry recognition.

It's amazing, isn't it? It's everywhere and so powerful. 

I'm specifically interested in the power of AI.

It's this living breathing thing that everyone is telling us it will take OUR JOBS and RULE THE WORLD. 


I'm a founder, but also a creative and aspiring category designer. I work with people like yourself to give them the power of AI to save them alot of money on cloud infrastructure.
Cloud is at the core of any technology we use today, so I want to make it cheaper.

I've built a few ambitious startups in my day, and today I am building MilkStraw AI.

Now since you made it here, You can have some of my credentials. 

I founded my first startup in 2011, I wanted to put my computer on a dongle (Macbooks were heavy, okay!) and run it on any screen straight from the cloud, but cloud computing was insane $$$.

After that an app and Ipad POS for restaurants

When you walk into a restaurant these days (post corona), you scan a barcode to see the menu (I did that), I did the ordering part too (It is just logical), but restaurants were being hard-headed.
We gave restaurants one of the first IPad POS. They used 90s style computer POS that cost them a S*** ton of $$$$, to print orders (stone age?), no meaning full analytics, and a super complicated system.

Lastly, Laxford Capital, A super awesome Hedge fund, we are working on an AI to fully automate the trading process, from Stock picking to stock purchase.

Oh, if you are still wondering...

After two decades at the front lines of programmatic ads (co-founder, Chango → acquired for $122 M) and mar-tech product leadership (Chief Product Officer, Rubicon Project; Global Media VP, iCrossing/Hearst), I saw the same pattern repeating with generative AI: huge promise, even bigger confusion.

So we built FOMO.ai to give companies something better than another “tool” — an AI marketing team partnered with our Human Marketing Team. This AI + Human approach is loved by brands like Noom, Minted, PetMeds, and many smaller B2B & B2B brands.

Our self-serve version is now rapidly expanding, with dedicated programs for freelancers and remote workers.

My nerd-out background is evolutionary genetics, which makes me acutely aware of AI’s broader ripple effects, like an AI-enabled elite versus everyone else, or how digital companionship could accelerate population decline. That lens keeps our mission grounded in people-first outcomes, even when the “teammate” isn’t human. Read more about the future of AI at 84Futures.com.

WHAT I'M FOCUSED ON NOW...
1. Generating real results for our Clients.
2. Agency partnerships: equipping digital shops with the FOMO.ai playbook and platform to serve clients at scale 
3. AI literacy: workshops, keynotes, and the AI Interviewer framework that turns subject-matter experts into prolific content creators.

LET'S CONNECT IF...
1. You’re wrestling with how to operationalize AI in marketing.
2. You want an honest take on AI’s societal impact (and how business leaders can steer it responsibly).

I’ve had the great fortune of working in this space since my early 20s, supporting some of the most significant leadership and cultural transformations in modern business. We helped organizations like HP, where Carly Fiorina launched a Dynamic Leadership program for tens of thousands of managers; Home Depot, where Bob Nardelli drove large-scale transformation for all Store Managers; and PepsiCo, where Waggl was used to elevate the authentic voice of employees to simplify work and activate values. Alongside these large-scale efforts, we have also partnered with some of the most respected learning and development organizations, including Ken Blanchard and the Center for Creative Leadership, to help enable the change and deliver impact for their learners. 

Previously, I co-founded and led Waggl, an employee feedback platform recognized for both rapid growth and cultural impact:

2× Financial Times Americas’ Fastest-Growing Companies (#45)
3× Best Places to Work – San Francisco Business Times
2× Top Workplaces – Bay Area News Group (#5 Small Companies)
Named one of Forbes’ Best Startup Employers
Acquired by Perceptyx in 2021

By combining conversational AI with practical learning design and data analytics, we help people apply what they learn and help organizations measure impact, making it easier to drive change that sticks.

I believe great companies put their people first, and that the best leaders balance their regard for people and performance. I was fortunate to be introduced to entrepreneurship at the dinner table and later through my studies at Babson College. In the future, I’m interested in creating more equitable entrepreneurial opportunities for individuals with the vision and grit, but not always the experience and support, to bring their ideas to life.

As CEO and founder of Ngentix, I lead a team reshaping enterprise automation with behaviorally adaptive software, a new category beyond traditional SaaS. Our agentic platform is designed for outcomes, not workflows. We connect fragmented systems, unify data, and deliver intelligent execution without dashboards, dev teams, or IT bottlenecks.

Over the past 20+ years, I’ve helped transform how the world works scaling fulfillment at Wayfair, modernizing platforms at Nike and AppNexus, and co-building TradeLens with Maersk and IBM, impacting global shipping and customs.

Now, with Ngentix, we’re building on that experience to fix what’s broken in enterprise software: complexity, rigidity, and human-unfriendly interfaces. Our platform already powers agent-based versions of systems like Slack, QuickBooks, Salesforce, Jira, Notion, Workday, and more.

I also write, speak, and advise on:

Building truly agentic systems (beyond simple AI wrappers)

Shifting execution power to domain experts, not developers

Architecting the AI-powered company from the ground up

Designing unified data layers for adaptive automation

I’m unapologetically optimistic about AI not because it replaces humans, but because it amplifies what we’re capable of.

Author | Creative Director | Horror Entertainment Visionary

I am a multi-published author, horror industry veteran, and the founder and Creative Director of Knightfall Entertainment, where for over 16 years I’ve brought immersive nightmares to life through theatrical experiences, live horror shows, and haunted attractions that push the boundaries of fear and storytelling.

With a background in film and theatre, I’ve written, produced, directed, and performed in dozens of original productions, earning a reputation for my bold vision, intense character work, and emotionally driven horror narratives. I specialize in stage combat, SFX makeup, immersive set design, and live event direction—crafting entire worlds that engulf audiences from the moment they step inside.

As a writer, I’ve published a growing library of works that explore the darkest corners of the human psyche, love, the paranormal, and ancient mythologies:

Books by Eddie Wenrich:
	•	Back to Me (Fictionalized memoir about true love, addiction, and redemption)
	•	Angel of Mine (Romantic drama inspired by soulmates and fate)
	•	The Haunting of Bernville (Terrifying true story of a demonic haunting)
	•	In the Eyes of Darkness (Chilling paranormal thriller told through the eyes of a child)
	•	Dreamland (Horror thriller about an abandoned amusement park with a bloody past)
	•	Skinner’s House (Psychological horror centered around a serial killer in the woods of PA)
	•	The Gospel of Flame (Epic fall of Lucifer and the birth of Hell’s Princes)
	•	Enki: Book 1 - Exodus of the Gods (Ancient alien epic blending Sumerian lore with interstellar war)
	•	Enki: Book 2 - The Martian Reckoning
	•	Enki: Book 3 - Echoes of Europa

My work fuses myth, history, and horror into stories that linger long after the lights go out. I’m also an experienced paranormal investigator and storyteller, constantly pursuing the line between fiction and terrifying reality.

Whether it’s through a haunted stage, a demonic tale, or a chilling novel, I’m here to leave audiences breathless—and just a little bit afraid.

Pet Portal AI,Active,Ryan Gruzen,Founder Building Trustworthy AI for Pet Health | We Save Pets' Lives,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-gruzen,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Building technology that enhances the most important relationships in life.

Two years ago, I made a decision that surprised everyone, including myself. After 20 years building a successful video production career, I walked away to solve a problem that affects 70% of American households: what to do when your pet needs help and you don't know if it's an emergency.

The catalyst? A terrifying night with my Shih-Tzu Cooper that exposed a massive gap in pet healthcare accessibility. Between unreliable Facebook groups and $5,000 emergency vet bills, pet parents are left guessing when their companions need help most.

So I built Pet Portal AI and our Pet Health Advisor. Our specialized AI provides instant, trustworthy pet health guidance without the hallucinations that make generic AI dangerous for medical advice. We've engineered Constitutional AI principles into every response, ensuring accuracy comes first, always.

What makes this different? We're not replacing veterinarians, we're enhancing their ability to serve more families by handling the flood of ""is this an emergency?"" questions that overwhelm the system. Dr. Marty Becker called it a game-changer for addressing the service desert in pet care.

The validation has been incredible. Pet parents finally have trusted guidance in those critical moments. And when Cooper's eye required removal this year, our own system helped me navigate that heartbreaking decision. The ultimate test of technology built with love.

This isn't just a career pivot. It's a movement toward technology that actually enhances human capability rather than replacing it. Every interaction we design serves one purpose: helping pets and people live happier, healthier lives together.
