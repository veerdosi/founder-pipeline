Beeline,Active,Gregory Ellis,🚀 Let's blast off,https://au.linkedin.com/in/gregory-ellis-7b556810,"Alella, Catalonia, Spain","My interest in consumer finance kicked off just after finishing my International Business and Economics degrees. Like many 20-somethings, I was terrible with money — “king for a day, fool for a fortnight.” Turns out I wasn’t the only one.

So in 2005, Sean Teahan and I co-founded Nimble — funded by the modest success of A-Team Health Recruitment and mowing a lot of lawns. We built a household brand that made small loans feel refreshingly simple. At the time, we had no idea we were pioneering fintech in Australia. Nimble grew to 150 staff and over $50 million in revenue.

Then in 2016, like many before me, I joined the not-so-exclusive club of founders ousted by their own boards. Cue a two-year sabbatical by the lake in Gandria, Switzerland, where I met my brilliant Spanish wife Miriam and helped launch Little Phil — a microphilanthropy app that gave donors their daily doce of 'Phil-good' moments.

In 2019, I jumped into another David vs Goliath project — my favourite kind — with some friends. We built Beeline, a US mortgage lender with beautiful UX, clever AI, and a mission to kill the soul-crushing home loan journey. We helped everyone from gig workers to property investors get home loans faster. Highlights: being listed on the NASDAQ and launching the world’s first AI mortgage sales assistant.

Now I’m advising the brilliant team at MagicBlocks — an AI startup doing some impressive work. These aren’t your usual rage-inducing, scripted ‘crapbots’. MagicBlocks’ agents are charismatic digital naturals — engaging 15x more visitors, listening, solving problems, and converting like nothing else — all while freeing up human teams.

When I’m not tweaking UX or poking holes in conversion funnels, I’m probably surfing, biking, doing yoga, tinkering with my putting stroke, or hanging with Miriam and our two little ones, Lola and Rapha.",50.0,,Advisor,MagicBlocks · Self-employed,Co-Founder,Beeline · Full-time,Co Founder Strategy Marketing and Product,Little Phil,Griffith University,"Bachelor of Commerce - BCom, Economics",Griffith University,International Business,,,,,,0,,,0.0,0.0,neutral,,,,,L5,"Gregory Ellis demonstrates a strong track record as a growth-stage entrepreneur with multiple successful ventures.

Hayden AI,Active,Chris Carson,Global AI Leader| Serial Entrepreneur | Founder & CEO of EchoTwin AI | Founder & Former CEO of Hayden AI,https://www.linkedin.com/in/cwcarson,"San Francisco, California, United States","As cities grow more complex, Chris Carson is leading a new era of urban intelligence. As the Founder and Global CEO of EchoTwin AI, he’s not just advancing technology—he’s transforming how cities function. His mission: to move cities beyond “smart” and toward something more powerful—cognitive, self-healing infrastructure.

Chris’s journey began with Hayden AI, where he developed vehicle-mounted, AI-powered systems that enforced traffic violations in real time. The technology was adopted by major U.S. cities and became a blueprint for mobile enforcement.

But enforcement alone wasn’t enough. It brought accountability but didn’t solve root issues. Cities needed more than detection—they needed awareness and autonomous action. That realization led to the founding of EchoTwin AI.

EchoTwin is Carson’s answer to fragmented urban systems. The platform uses edge AI, vision-language models (VLMs), and digital twins to turn everyday municipal fleets—like street sweepers and waste trucks—into mobile sensing units. These vehicles don’t just observe—they interpret and trigger automated workflows in real time.

From potholes and broken signs to overflowing bins and environmental hazards, EchoTwin detects and contextualizes issues and initiates resolution—autonomously. It’s not just visibility—it’s cognition. That’s what separates EchoTwin from traditional “smart city” solutions.

For Chris, this is about more than tools—it’s about redefining cities. Cognitive cities are resilient, responsive, and self-healing. EchoTwin enables this by merging siloed data into a unified, intelligent operational layer—the city’s digital nervous system.

With over 20 years of experience in AI, machine learning, and public-sector innovation, Chris has founded and scaled multiple successful tech companies. He combines deep technical knowledge with a relentless focus on execution and is recognized for delivering measurable impact.

A pragmatic operator, Chris champions Design Thinking, Lean Startup methods, and co-creation as keys to building scalable, lasting solutions. Under his leadership, EchoTwin has secured key government partnerships across the U.S. and Middle East and attracted top-tier investors aligned with his vision.

As EchoTwin expands globally, Chris’s goal is clear: the cities of tomorrow won’t just be smart—they’ll be cognitive, adaptive, and built to last.",57.0,,Founder | Global CEO | Chairman of the Board,EchoTwin AI · Full-time,Founder | Global CEO | Chairman of the Board,Hayden AI · Full-time,Founder | CEO | Chairman of the Board,Nueevo Technologies · Full-time,Waseda University,"Master of Science (M.S.) & Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Information Architecture, Computer Vision - Signal Processing Lab",Lynn University,"Bachelor of Science (B.S.), International Business Management, Asian Studies",Geospatial Data,Spatial AI,Edge Computing,Digital twin,Go-to-Market Strategy,3,Recognition on the GovTech100 list for four consecutive years; Named one of America’s Top GreenTech Companies of 2024 by TIME Magazine,Interviewed by 7ITS News during Intertraffic 2024; Public statements on AI and urban mobility technology,,8.0,positive,,,,Made the Pro Bowl in 2020 as an alternate; Signed a two-year deal with the Seattle Seahawks worth up to $14.625 million in 2021; Accumulated career earnings of over $10 million in the NFL,L4,"Chris Carson demonstrates characteristics of a proven operator with significant technical expertise and entrepreneurial experience.

Prifina,Active,Jouko Ahvenainen,"Entrepreneur, Business Executive, Investor, Author",https://mc.linkedin.com/in/joukoahvenainen,"Monaco, Monaco","My dream and work is to create new things and get them to work in practice. I don’t take easy paths. I started my first business when I was 16. I have started a few startups, most of them being pioneers in their areas and built significant global business, invested in startups, and worked for global corporations where I did significant turnaround and new business projects.

I focus on data, analytics, fintech, and ML/AI solutions. I am very hands-on in my startups. I have vast experience of international business in Asia, Europe, and North America; I have lived and/or worked in Monaco, London, Austin, San Francisco, Singapore, Helsinki, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. 

I hold three academic degrees in politics, finance and computer science, and a pilot license. I have written books and to publications (business, technology, geopolitics, military) and lived on three continents. I have never followed recommended career paths, and I believe broad knowledge and the right attitude is the way to get things happen and also make the world a better place.

I have a strong track record to pioneer new businesses and technology. I have been a founder in companies that have been first in the world to make social network analytics for marketing and risk management, equity crowdfunding (influencing on the US President and Congress to change regulation), vertical AI solution (personal data AI and geopolitics). 

I have often been the first one to get first customers in new countries and managed personally up to $40M annual sales. In corporations I started new business units, setup European operations for a US company, and made a total turnaround for an Asian joint-venture. I have also been an external expert for work groups of the EU Council, US government, MIT Enterprise Program, Vietnam Innovation Program and the Finnish Defence Forces.

My startups have also raised significant funding, but at the same time I always prefer strong business and revenue over fancy VC deal announcements. 

I plan to do unexpected things also in the future. 

I regularly speak about new technology and business in conferences and media including CNBC Squawk Box, SXSW, MWC, Drucker Forum and Horasis. I have been listed as a World Influencer in the Digital Industry and Fintech.

I hold an MBA from Aalto University and McCombs School of Business, at University of Texas, Austin and a M.Sc. from the School of Science, at Aalto University, and B.Soc.Sc. at the University of Helsinki.

At TruEra. We have created the first Full Lifecycle AI Observability software for Generative & Predictive AI applications by combining monitoring, testing, debugging/root cause analytics, AI explainability and responsible AI capabilities into a single solution. Based on research started by my co-founders at CMU 8+ years ago, TruEra has capabilities not available anywhere else.

AI has the power to transform every industry but actually building AI applications that can sustainably hit their organizational objectives is very difficult. AI applications can experience many types of problems: don't hit KPIs, non-optimal performance/quality, operational (e.g. can't explain or build trust), responsible AI (e.g. concerns around bias). LLM applications have created a new set of challenges including challenges around hallucinations and security/privacy. TruEra's mission is to solve these problems and ""Ensure effective and trustworthy AI for everyone.""

In my career, my focus has been on understanding new problems in the world and then bringing new technologies and products to market to solve these problems.  I like starting and growing new companies as a way to do this. I've built 8 products so far as the lead product manager or general manager and launched countless features/modules as part of this.  For 6 of these, I was playing a lead role in building them largely from scratch.  All of these have achieved multi-million dollar run rates. For 4 of these products, I not only led the building of the product but I played a lead role in securing the first set of customers and designing the go-to-market (i.e. sales and marketing approach). 

I have not done any of these things alone and have been fortunate to work with amazing colleagues and a part of great teams. I'm working with a fantastic team at Truera and we are looking for more of these people now!

Latitude,Active,Nick Walton,CEO of Latitude | Built AI Dungeon (8M+ downloads) | Building Heroes: an AI RPG Engine that can bring any world to life,https://www.linkedin.com/in/waltonnick,San Francisco Bay Area,"I became hooked on two things: the creative freedom of D&D and the potential of AI to enhance games. When I combined them during a hackathon in 2019 the result was AI Dungeon.

From BYU's Perception, Control & Cognition lab to Aurora's autonomous vehicles, I kept seeing AI's potential to create new things. Then came AI Dungeon - one of the first commercial applications of GPT models. We grew so fast we hit a $20K server bill in week one. 

We had to shut it down, and within two days our community built an entire peer-to-peer network to bring it back online because they loved it so much.

That taught me something crucial: focus on giving value to users first, everything else follows.

After 6 years and 10+ AI game prototypes, we've discovered how to create experiences that current games can't touch:

- Dynamic worlds where your choices really matter
- Unique stories personalized to you
- Freedom to do anything you can imagine
- Characters that really feel alive

Think Minecraft meets D&D, powered by AI:

- Persistent worlds where your actions are remembered
- Deep progression systems giving you unique skills based on your choices
- Rich AI characters that truly live and respond
- Epic narratives that pit you against imposing odds

We're building the kind of game I dreamed about when first rolling D20s - where the only limit is your imagination.

- Created one of the first commercial GPT applications in 2019
- Pioneer in AI gaming - built one of the first commercial GPT applications in 2019
- Created AI Dungeon, reaching 8M+ downloads
- Worked on autonomous vehicles at Aurora
- Developed LLM-based game course with Together AI
- Led multiple innovations in AI/gaming fusion
- Built an engine that enables dynamic, persistent game worlds

Building the future of gaming at Latitude:
- Hiring senior AI & game engineers
- Early access to Heroes coming soon
- Follow for AI gaming insights

From text adventures to today's AI worlds - we're just getting started.

I worked as a communication scientist and researcher at the University of Southern California’s Institute for Creative Technologies (USC ICT) for almost 12 years by working for the Mixed Reality (MxR) Group, the Medical Virtual Reality (MedVR) Group, and the Computational Emotion Group. My research focused on affective human-agent interaction in social and psychotherapeutic interactions. I adopted interdisciplinary theoretical and methodological approaches to my research, specifically in social and clinical psychological contexts. 

I have participated in projects funded by the National Science Foundation and the US military. I modeled a novel approach to explore interactants' perceptions of co-presence and the medium of the interaction. This included integrating virtual humans into emotionally engaging computer-mediated interactions. Using the approach, I researched investigating virtual humans as virtual counselors in mixed-reality settings including smartphone applications. I appeared in The New York Times with my work (“In Cybertherapy, Avatars Assist With Healing”) and received the ""New Investigator Award"" for a presentation of outstanding research quality at the CyberTherapy & CyberPsychology conference.

I obtained an M.Sc. from the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia, and a Ph.D. from the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York, majoring in Communication with a concentration in Human-Computer Interaction.

I don’t take easy paths. I started my first business when I was 16. I have started a few startups, most of them being pioneers in their areas and built significant global business, invested in startups, and worked for global corporations where I did significant turnaround and new business projects.

I focus on data, analytics, fintech, and ML/AI solutions. I am very hands-on in my startups. I have vast experience of international business in Asia, Europe, and North America; I have lived and/or worked in Monaco, London, Austin, San Francisco, Singapore, Helsinki, Kuala Lumpur and Hong Kong. 

I hold three academic degrees in politics, finance and computer science, and a pilot license. I have written books and to publications (business, technology, geopolitics, military) and lived on three continents. I have never followed recommended career paths, and I believe broad knowledge and the right attitude is the way to get things happen and also make the world a better place.

I have a strong track record to pioneer new businesses and technology. I have been a founder in companies that have been first in the world to make social network analytics for marketing and risk management, equity crowdfunding (influencing on the US President and Congress to change regulation), vertical AI solution (personal data AI and geopolitics). 

I have often been the first one to get first customers in new countries and managed personally up to $40M annual sales. In corporations I started new business units, setup European operations for a US company, and made a total turnaround for an Asian joint-venture. I have also been an external expert for work groups of the EU Council, US government, MIT Enterprise Program, Vietnam Innovation Program and the Finnish Defence Forces.

My startups have also raised significant funding, but at the same time I always prefer strong business and revenue over fancy VC deal announcements. 

I plan to do unexpected things also in the future. 

I regularly speak about new technology and business in conferences and media including CNBC Squawk Box, SXSW, MWC, Drucker Forum and Horasis. I have been listed as a World Influencer in the Digital Industry and Fintech.

I hold an MBA from Aalto University and McCombs School of Business, at University of Texas, Austin and a M.Sc. from the School of Science, at Aalto University, and B.Soc.Sc. at the University of Helsinki.

to get an accurate picture of them. They’re too small for large data providers to register and monitor
consistently.
As a result, identifying and winning SMB clients is expensive compared to the incremental revenue
each one brings in. Keeping on top of their evolving needs is even more challenging.

possible to capture this market efficiently.

I specialize in building world-class commercial teams, aligning go-to-market strategy with business objectives, and delivering sustainable ARR growth through client alignment, strategic partnerships, and complex enterprise deals. 

I’ve led global growth, launched entirely new revenue divisions, and helped companies break into new markets. One of my proudest milestones was leading the positioning and negotiation of a $600M exclusive deal with Apple - an idea we shaped from scratch and brought to life by aligning product vision, supply chain readiness, and executive trust.

Across my career, I’ve repeatedly tripled ARR at an AI startup, scaled a SaaS division to $100M+, reversed multi-year revenue declines, and rapidly secured 25+ enterprise contracts with companies like Amazon, ADP, and Amex. My transformational efforts span 9 companies and 3 continents, with a focus on scaling what works, fixing what doesn’t, and accelerating what’s next.

I’ve also led a $40M commercial turnaround with 35% EBITDA improvement, launched strategic accounts programs that consistently drove 40–50% YoY growth, secured a $20M deal with Verizon to launch a new business unit, and delivered a 3x increase in average deal size through enterprise sales transformation. I’ve closed $700M+ in high-impact contracts, built cross-functional teams of 100, and driven GTM expansion across North America, Asia, and Europe.

Our mission is simple: Secure the software supply chain at its true origin—the developer and the AI systems writing the code.

Our platform integrates across the SDLC to surface real-time behavioral and risk signals—linking developer activity (human and AI), AI-generated code, and organizational risk.

We’ve filed patents for a new security layer:

* Developer Security Posture Management (DevSPM)
* Developer SIEM (DevSIEM)
* Developer Detection & Response (DevDR)
* Developer Posture & Prediction Engine (DevPPE)

I bring 20+ years across technology, software, cybersecurity, AI, cloud, infrastructure, and product strategy—with a JD from Berkeley and battle-tested leadership experience.

I’m also authoring Provenant, a sci-if tech-thriller exploring a future timeline when the vast majority of code is written by autonomous systems and AI—with human governance and the risks and implications for humanity in the age of systematic digital automation underpinning all infrastructure.

If you’re building in cybersecurity, AI, DevSecOps, or working toward creating more secure AI futures—I’d love to connect.

I have five years of experience in investment banking and public accounting, followed by six years in startups.
 
I was a member of the Leadership Team at ActZero, a cybersecurity company incubated by Point72 Ventures, which grew to over 60 employees and raised $70 million in capital. During this time, I contributed to the launch of the company as the Director of Strategic Operations and Business Planning and to the growth and expansion of our go-to-market strategy as the Director of Partnerships. I worked with R&D to prioritize product feature development and execute on alternative service delivery methods. Following our first acquisition, I led a six-month integration process. In this role, I collaborated with a team of cross-functional leaders resulting in the completion of over 150 integration projects, ranging from data-informed ideal customer profile analysis to cultivation of our company culture. I also worked in tandem with the part-time CFO managing the company’s financials and ensuring that department leaders had the necessary resources to maximize their impact on ActZero’s growth. 

While in investment banking, I honed my skills in deal structuring, analytics, and execution, and parlayed that experience into the startup ecosystem. I was hired into my first role in Silicon Valley as a Chief of Staff, and ultimately held responsibilities in Business Operations, Business Development, and Customer Success at companies backed by investors including Sequoia, Redpoint, and CRV.

I drive transformative AI and product strategies, deliver innovative solutions, and accelerate business growth. 

To accomplish this, one must prioritize employee engagement and empower their teams to succeed. As a pragmatic, focused mentor and manager, I have experience attracting, recruiting, and managing teams of up to 62. 

As an Entrepreneur & Inventor with PhD in AI (Autonomous agents & Multi-agent systems), over a dozen publications, reviewer for leading NLP conferences, and expertise in commercializing AI research, I’ve repeatedly delivered transformational outcomes integrating AI into products and operations. 

Incubating ideas from inception to market-leading AI products, and scaling them to drive explosive growth is where I’m most effective.

As CEO & co-founder of Quantivly, I’m building an agentic-AI “air-traffic-control” layer so every scanner runs better, staff are freed to focus on care, and every patient is seen sooner.

Why it matters>
Interpretive AI is easing the traditional reading backlog, but idle scanners, scheduling gaps, and siloed workflows have become the new choke point. Quantivly automates the decisions that keep imaging moving—boosting throughput, shortening wait times, and letting clinicians devote more time to patients.

My path>
• Started coding at 12; youngest finalist in Prologin, France’s 36-hour national programming marathon, at 15
• B.Eng. Computer Science (ranked #2, 2004)
• M.S. Computer Vision (2005)
• Ph.D. Applied Mathematics (2009, “Best Ph.D.” award) for *AI agent-based* brain-MRI segmentation
• Post-doc, Computational Radiology Lab, Boston Children’s Hospital (2009)
• AI Scientist, Boston Children’s Hospital (2014)
• Assistant Professor of Radiology, Harvard Medical School (2018)
• 50+ peer-reviewed papers, multiple innovation awards, two granted U.S. patents, more pending.

The aha moment>
After 12 years in a leading pediatric radiology department, I realized we measure almost everything except the operations that determine access. Quantivly is the answer: real-time situational awareness, predictive orchestration, and autonomous agents that coordinate rooms, people, and equipment.

I believe that change is best accomplished using a thoughtful and transparent process. I am skilled at identifying the target, envisioning the pathway, and guiding the team to success.

When these ropes fail, people lose their lives and companies lose their reputations. 

At Scope, we address the safety of these critical rope applications with the latest advancements technology has to offer. We are currently focused on Electric Utility Construction and Maintenance where we are equipping operators with the ability to know the break strength of their pulling lines - without actually breaking them. This means no more ""educated guesses"" on whether or not the line is fit for service. Companies can confidently know that their lines are fit for the task.

I came to the US in the late '90s to pursue a Master’s in AI (my thesis was in AI Agents) —only to discover the field was still in its early stages. I found Java instead and fell in love with it.

My journey in Silicon Valley started as an engineer at Sun Microsystems (the home of Java!), crafting enterprise Java EE & GlassFish OSS App Server, but it was at Persistent Systems—a small startup at the time—that I caught the entrepreneurial bug. 

While at Sun, I discovered Jenkins, bet on its transformative potential, and became its first Product Manager and Product Marketing Manager.

This foresight led me to CloudBees, where as VP of Product Management, I helped find product-market fit and scaled the company from $0 to $50M ARR on Enterprise Jenkins. Later, as GM of Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud, I witnessed the power of Atlassian’s famed PLG motion firsthand.

In 2019, fueled by these experiences, I co-founded Launchable Inc., using AI to revolutionize software testing (finally fulfilling my dream of landing in the US to do something with AI :-)). Backed by top-tier VCs like Battery Ventures, Unusual Ventures, and 645 Ventures, we scaled the business until its successful acquisition by CloudBees in 2024. A brief stint as an Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) at Matrix Partners also offered me valuable insights from the investor’s lens.


Career Highlights:

- Co-Head of AI and VP of Product at CloudBees

- Co-founder and CEO of Launchable Inc. (acquired by CloudBees in 2024)

- Scaled CloudBees from $0 to $50M ARR as Head of Product Management

- Head of Product/GM for Atlassian Bitbucket Cloud, experiencing Atlassian's PLG motion

- Engineer/Product Manager/Group Product Marketing Manager in the Java EE division at Sun Microsystems

- Entrepreneur-in-Residence (EIR) at Matrix Partners (brief stint)

Launchable,Active,Kohsuke Kawaguchi,I help software development and product leaders ship 2-5x faster without risk,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kohsukekawaguchi,"San Jose, California, United States","80% of software tests are pointless. The problem is we just don’t know which 80%. 

Software development and product leaders come to Launchable when they feel that:

➡️  Issues are found too late in the development cycle and releases get delayed.

➡️  Long testing cycles become a bottleneck in the delivery velocity.

➡️  Too much WIP & not enough in production as developers cannot push changes fast enough.

➡️  Unhappy developers, because they are juggling too many WIP balls.

➡️  Testing infrastructure costs are increasing but the testing queue is only getting longer. 

After working together software engineering and product leaders walk away feeling proactive, ahead of the curve because:

1️⃣  Their developers and releases fail fast as issues were found earlier.

2️⃣  Shorter testing loops (reducing hours to minutes) and development cycles (days to hours).

3️⃣  Developers push code to production earlier and have less WIP.

4️⃣  Developers are happier because they get lightning-fast feedback and don’t have to juggle too many balls.

5️⃣  Leaders are spending less on testing infrastructure yet the test queue is shorter.

✅  Most important, development and product leaders get the *CONFIDENCE* they can shorten development cycles and ship new products and features in weeks, not months…without increasing risk or complicating the development workflow.
Running pointless tests slows up development velocity. We’ll help you get ahead of the curve by showing you the 20% of tests that matter. Launchable’s machine learning identifies and runs the tests with the highest probability of failing (based on code/test metadata) to speed up the dev feedback loop and velocity.

WHAT OTHERS SAY:

“My test runtime went down 90%. Deployment to Heroku went from 30 to 10 minutes. It is great, just great!” 
- Masayuki Oguni, CEO, Manba

“Launchable saves us 25% of resources on the mainline build while going faster.”

At Auger, lead development of Analytics and Data platforms to build the leading AI-driven platform for Supply Chains around the world.

As the Co-Founder and CEO of Plunk, introduced a new evolution of analytics via the first generative AI-driven analytics platform for the world’s largest asset class-residential real estate. Plunk was acquired by Home.AI in 2024.

Prior to Plunk, founded one of the largest mobile AI companies, Medio Systems, supporting 440+ million consumers in over 100+ countries. In 2014, Medio was acquired by Nokia (HERE Technologies), and joined as its Chief Technology Officer. As CTO lead a worldwide R&D organization and spearheaded the company’s primary technology roadmap and strategic direction including product innovation, research, and overall AI technology development and strategy. 

Previous to HERE, spent much of my earlier career leading groundbreaking analytics and data-driven systems for companies including IBM and Junglee, acquired by Amazon in 1998. At Amazon, created the company’s first large-scale AI & data analytics platform, formed its analytic infrastructure and integrated Junglee’s recommendations engine into Amazon’s data-driven consumer UX and predictive analytics system – which ultimately today drive 30+% of Amazon sales.  I also lead a fintech spin-off from Amazon, Intelligent Results, applying real-time NLP & predictive text analytics-decades prior to the advent of LLMs--to build an improved FICO score that was acquired by First Data Corp (FDC).

While earning a Masters and Ph.D. candidacy at Stanford University in Computer Science, in 1995 I co-founded with fellow student Sergey Brin ""Mining Data at Stanford"" (MiDAS), the research lab where we incubated the Google crawler and search engine. Prior to Stanford, founded my first company, Micro Revelations, an early pioneer of AI-driven PC computer games, acquired by Electronic Arts.

A recipient of both the prestigious National Science Foundation and Department of Defense Office of Naval Research Graduate Fellowships, I have the honor of being a key industry thought leader and author of numerous professional publications and patents. In 2008-2009 became a member of the World Economic Forum, selected as a technology visionary pioneer for innovations in mobile-optimized AI.

I’m curious and don’t accept the status quo if my instincts tell me they could be better. 

I got my meaningful start in entrepreneurship after joining the legal industry, where I built great technology and one of our industry’s fastest growing companies. 

I then shifted my attention to advertising; with a few friends, I co-founded Model B - a now highly awarded digital advertising agency. I was interested in the use of data to understand consumer behavior. 

After 6 years of wrestling with existing technology for measuring, optimizing and drawing insights from massive advertising campaigns, I decided to build something better. 

The biggest problem was complexity. While many pieces of technology sought to answer what you should do with your ad dollars, they require an army of analysts, platform experts, and expensive subscriptions. 

In 2022, I spun out of our agency a technology that aims to shepherd in a new era of advertising that anyone can use and get incredible results. It guides the marketing team and simplifies all the key decision points. 

Blueprint will empower the future of commerce and media management. 

We are now working to bring Blueprint to the advertising industry.

CHER®,Active,Eric Chebil,Founder at Cher® & Nest Navigate | Engineer/Real Estate Broker/MLO/LEED AP,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericchebil,"Santa Monica, California, United States","👋 I’m Eric Chebil, Managing Broker and Founder of Cher® and Nest Navigate — on a mission to redefine the path to homeownership through education, technology, and innovation.

After starting my career at Swinerton Builders and earning my LEED® AP credential, I transitioned from commercial construction to founding Cher®, a real estate edtech company featured in Forbes for our unique approach to housing. Cher® empowers Realtors and Loan Officers through tools, coaching, and co-ownership options—built to meet today’s affordability challenges head-on.

Most recently, I launched Nest Navigate, a completely separate company focused on gamified homebuyer education. Nest Navigate is designed for first-time renters and buyers who want to learn at their own pace—and get rewarded while doing it. Through personalized AI-driven courses and a Nest Coin rewards system, we’re making financial literacy fun, accessible, and motivating.

I believe the future of real estate lies in transparency, education, and accessibility—and I’m proud to lead ventures that are working to build that future.

Strategy and implementation rooted in data is where I love to live... which is why marketing was a natural fit for me. Understanding consumer/persona behavior (hot tip... they behave and react just like you and me... if you wouldn't engage... they wont either) and combining that with the data and metrics that matter the most to a brand to build impactful sales and marketing processes and strategies… makes working in marketing challenging and exciting at the same time.

Thankfully, I have had the opportunity to build a career in a field that I enjoy and has led to me becoming a seasoned data-driven professional in marketing operations, growth marketing, demand generation, and more.  I've directed successful initiatives, maximizing ROI and market share... taken start-up brands from assisted to unassisted awareness (quantifiable), achieved meaningful boosts in brand engagement, and increased top-of-funnel activity by several multiples for b2b SaaS firms. I have also led campaigns and strategies for major clients including AT&T and the NFL Alumni Association. 

With an MBA (Marketing focus), MIT Sloan Digital Marketing Certification, and proficiency in platforms like Salesforce and Adobe Creative Suite, I bring a unique blend of strategic planning, analytics, and creative expertise. Let's connect to explore how I can drive success for your team. #StrategicMarketing #CorporateSuccess #ROI

20+ Years of System Design, Software Implementation and Supply Chain Excellence
Director Level Solution Design Engineer, People Manager and Team Builder.

I love the supply chain industry.  It is the heart of our world economy.  My efforts make U.S. companies more efficient in the world market allowing more companies to grow, stay in the U.S. and serve my fellow citizens.  That is my superpower.

As with most individuals that advance through companies, I have become more of a team building and people manager than an engineer.  My philosophy as a team builder is best articulated by the authors of the following books: ‘The 5 Dysfunctions of a Team’ by P. Lencioni, ‘The Speed of Trust’ by Stephen M.R. Covey and ‘Leaders Eat Last’ by Simon Sinek. It is of upmost importance to me to work with, and develop, high quality teams that produce outstanding individuals.
 
My operational and consulting philosophies are best described through the books ‘The Goal’ by Eliyahu Goldratt and ‘Getting Naked’ by Patrick Lencioni. When it comes to system design or operation, I view the process to be of utmost importance - over and beyond whichever technology is used. While I am a Champion of World Class Automation and Fulfillment, I believe you get there through process, continuous improvement, and quality management – not by buying equipment and hoping it does the job for you. And I feel that the above-mentioned books describe very well how to work the problem and build the relationships needed to achieve the initial designs and continuous improvement.
 
And finally … I really enjoy what I do. I truly think that we in logistics design have the most diverse, stimulating, and downright fun profession out there.

As an entrepreneur, haunched & exited four start-ups, I envisioned new market solutions as breakthroughs in a highly competitive technology space in different verticals.

At MachEye (acquired by VRNT, Verint), I created a modern analytics platform that gave an actionable ""play"" button to data. Created custom language models that offer Google-like search and YouTube-like audio-visual experiences, decision-makers at any level can receive actionable insights and recommendations. Unlike traditional analytical platforms that only provide answers to ""what"" questions on data, MachEye offers a comprehensive solution that enables users to answer ""what, why, and how"" scenarios for everyone in the organization. 

At SelectQ (acquired by Thinkster in 2020), I created an ed-tech platform that helps students with GetAI test questions on the fly, based on their skill level, providing with the right micro-tuned, generative (not just adaptive) content at the right time for them to master each subject. Using AI and NLG, the platform generates questions stream for all SAT topics , with ratcheting complexity until full preparation. All SelectQ’s profits are committed to the cause of helping needy with in-person STEM topics.

At Drastin (acquired by Splunk in 2017), I created the ""Conversational Analytics"" as a new BI market category for enterprise adoption, and the product was recognized as the top five AI platforms by Gartner, getting ranked as a ""cool vendor"" in search-driven data analytics, within just 30 months.

At Cloud360 Hyperplatform (acquired by Cognizant in 2012), I created “Cloud Management Platforms” as a new market category and built a multi-million dollar ARR business with triple-digit yearly revenue uptick. The product was ranked as a leader in MQ, by both Gartner and by 451 Research.

My focus has always been to develop market-leading innovations and breakthroughs, to make a case for them, organize and lead inspired teams, and preempt competition to conquer markets. This mantle required me to not just focus on technology and products, but also on the markets, competition, business growth, team leadership, and optimum resource management.

Before I founded AKA in 1998, I began my career working for Fleishman, Edelman and Golin where l learned from the best in the fields of marketing, communications, brand management and public relations. I quickly became a trusted, go-to partner and resource for top accounts including McDonald's, Campbell Soup and MillerCoors. As a budding entrepreneur in college, I led a 40-person staff for Pyramid Public Relations, a PRSSA Student-Run Agency while working part-time with Jimmy John to open the 2nd Jimmy John’s location.

Over my 30-year career, I’ve been fortunate to connect with the most influential people in the world working with brands as the lead for celebrity activations and sponsorships. As a Goldman Sachs 10K Small Businesses graduate, I’ve learned from business leaders including Warren Buffet, Michael Bloomberg, Sara Blakely, Jo Malone and Richard Branson. I enjoy working with entrepreneurs in several industry and entrepreneurial groups while volunteering with the Three Pillars Initiative, an organization teaching high school juniors and seniors the art and science of philanthropy.

In 2024, I founded KRAUSE BROS. LLC as a holding company aligned with my pasion projects and philanthropic activity. I’m available for advisory positions and will recruit, build and elevate teams of experts to deliver results. I’m the 2025 President-Elect for PRSA Chicago, the nation’s third largest chapter.

I graduated Southern Illinois University with a BS in speech communications and minors in journalism, public relations and marketing and continue to support the university and its Alumni Association.",55.0,,Founder & CEO,AKA · Full-time,President,Krause Bros.

Anvizent,Active,Raj Koneru,Founder | Supporting ambitious CXOs growth with AI and Data | Multiple Patents |Follow for posts about improving your business with AI and Data,https://www.linkedin.com/in/raj-koneru,Atlanta Metropolitan Area,"Twenty-five years in data taught me one hard truth: When data fails or slows down, so does everything else — decisions, teams, growth. 

Over the years, I’ve watched too many C-suite executives make the wrong decision— or no 
decision at all—because their data team needed “just one more week,” and they were left 
with their gut instincts or pulling numbers in Excel. I’ve seen businesses miss targets and leave serious money on the table — not because they didn't have data, but because it lacked the context and clarity to take the right next step. And I’ve seen promising AI initiatives lose their way — stuck waiting on pipelines that simply couldn’t keep up. 

The root cause was always the same: traditional data engineering simply wasn’t built for the speed, complexity, and pace of change in modern business. 

Every data request becomes a project—weeks of design, development, and validation. And when the question changes? You start over from scratch. 

So, I spent the last few years building what I wished had existed all along — a way to deliver integrated, accurate, actionable data instantly, without the delays, backlogs, or budget drains of traditional engineering cycles. 

That's Anvizent. 

Anvizent is a generative data pipeline platform powered by an agentic data management engine. Anvizent delivers integrated, accurate, actionable data - at the speed and scale of decision-making and AI.   

No data engineering cycles. No delays. 

You just follow 3 simple steps: 

Step 1: Define Your Data Requirements - Your business teams and analysts — not IT — configure the data requirements and business rules.
Step 2: Generate - Instantly generate complete pipelines that deliver integrated, accurate, actionable data. 
Step 3: Regenerate - When business rules or requirements change, simply regenerate pipelines instantly. 

What used to take weeks of data engineering now happens near-instantly. 

The results are transformative: 

- Near Instant access to integrated, accurate, actionable data delivered into your workflow 
- 90% reduction in resource requirements — one business analyst can now do the work of an entire data engineering team.  
 - 30% lower storage and data processing costs

Anvizent,Active,Laki Ponnam,Co-founder || 🚀 Helping ambitious executives accelerate growth using AI & Data || From Data bottlenecks to AI success 🚀 || Ready to transform your data into profit? Let's talk! 😎,https://www.linkedin.com/in/lakiponnam,"Atlanta, Georgia, United States","When ambitious business leaders need integrated, accurate, actionable data — instantly — I get them there, whatever it takes.

Whether it's for decision-making, AI, or workflow automation — no more data engineering cycles, no waiting.

Ask any business leader what's slowing them down — and it's almost always: they can't get the reliable, actionable data they need when they need it.

Here's what makes it frustrating: You've done everything right — invested in Power BI, hired consultants, deployed modern tools — and you're still missing timely, actionable insights. Data remains scattered across multiple applications with no unified view. You're waiting weeks for answers you need now. Opportunities slip through the cracks. Without clean, integrated data, your AI initiatives stall.

That's why we built Anvizent:
A Generative Data Pipelines platform powered by Agentic Data Management — eliminating the traditional data engineering bottleneck entirely. Instead of weeks of design, development, and validation cycles, businesses now get integrated, accurate, actionable data at the speed and scale of decision-making and AI. No data engineering cycles. No delays. No technical debt.

How Anvizent eliminates the data engineering bottleneck:

👉 Traditional Problem: Every data request becomes a project. Weeks and months of engineering cycles. When requirements change, you start over.
👉 Anvizent Solution: Domain experts configure data requirements and business rules — our agentic system instantly generates complete data pipelines without any coding.
👉 Continuous Adaptation: When business logic changes, pipelines regenerate instantly. No new projects, no engineering delays.
👉 Automatic Foundation Building: As you connect new data sources, Anvizent automatically creates a robust, integrated data foundation behind the scenes.
The best part? What used to take weeks of data engineering now happens near-instantly. You can deliver even complex data integrations in days, not months.

The results are transformative:

👉 10-figure PE firm: Expected 6 months, delivered in 15 days
👉 Next-gen company: Integrated 5 applications, cut operations costs 80%
👉 Financial services: Cut 4-month timeline to 2 weeks

I’ve spoken at most ivy universities, Davos on healthcare AI and impact investing, at the UN General Assembly on STEM innovation, at CES on the future of healthcare, and been featured on countless organic publications including Forbes, Hindustan Times, AARP, American Diabetes Association, Alzheimer’s Association, and others.

My industry knowledge ranges from tech to longevity, healthcare, the performing arts, cosmetics, fashion, and gastronomy. I have deep expertise in digital health, IoT, and Artificial Intelligence solutions- particularly in generative AI and voice based tech. I’ve built ventures in both B2B & B2C landscapes, in hardware, edge, and cloud-based offerings. I've managed global teams to launch new products that have generated hundreds of millions in revenue, bootstrapped numerous ventures of my own, and have helped drive two companies to successful exits.

In addition to Asha, I’ve founded several small businesses, advise a handful of Y Combinator, Techstars and 500 Startups ventures, and am a board member to a couple of nonprofits focused on helping increase access to care. 

I’ve been fortunate to have lived many lives in one- starting out as a dancer, actor, singer, model, and athlete, evolving into a writer, self taught chemist, gastronomist, and producer.

I fundamentally believe in the positive impact AI can have on our everyday lives; however, there are real concerns about ""black boxes"", risks of unfair systems, and an innate human desire to trust and understand why.

As founding CEO of Monitaur, an AI governance and assurance software company, I help business leaders and their organizations establish confidence and trust in AI systems. With governance and assurances, we can accelerate AI and all of its great potential.

My career as an intrepreneur has prepared me well with in-the-trenches experience driving innovation and solving challenges across the enterprise. While AI absolutely presents new technological considerations and complexities, like all innovation, success requires a foundation of alignment and collaboration amongst stakeholders. Building responsible AI systems and managing their risks is not just a technical problem - it is a business problem and Monitaur uniquely drives cross-functional collaboration and oversight.

Not only have I founded my own education/technology startup, but I have also invested in multiple education and technology companies.

My mission is to disrupt the education sector and advance technology, and I plan to do so by connecting my expertise, connections, and resources through my own public company.

✣ Accounting & Finance
➢ ➢ I have top training, including my Master’s in Accountancy Science (MAS) and Bachelor of Arts in Accounting, and started my career with the biggest accounting firm in the world. In addition, I am a member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA).

✣ Business Development
➢ ➢ On multiple occasions, I have forged meaningful and profitable relationships between investors, business stakeholders, and international industry leaders.

✣ Legal
➢ ➢ I managed the legal department, interactions with corporate and security lawyers, and compliance- and fundraising-related matters for each startup I founded and exited, as well as the public company I managed.

My experience as both COO and CEO has been built on my ability to run the business side of things in a startup. I inspire, cultivate, and execute new ideas, effectively manage change within the organization, and create links between resources to grow the company quickly. All this while ensuring exceptional customer experiences and satisfaction.

After graduating law school and working in finance, I found myself falling in love with technology - first as a founder of two mobile software companies and now as an early stage investor. Being a founder was the most humbling and challenging work of my life, and I’ve channeled many of the learnings into my investment style.

I was the Managing Director at Techstars for 7.5 years where I led investments into companies that now have a market cap of over $10B, prior to co-founding the global venture capital firm, Everywhere Ventures. Across these entities, I’ve been the first-money into 300+ tech-enabled companies including: Chainalysis, Alloy, Latch, Headway, Contra, Particle Health, Pair Eyewear, Adonis, Rupa Health, Morty, Wagmo, Smarthop, PathSpot, Cube, OnePipe, Season, Parsley Health and so many more: https://angel.co/jenny-fielding

When I’m not investing, you can find me catching up with founders around the world or hanging out with my students at Columbia University and Cornell Tech where I’m an Adjunct Professor.

While still in soft launch, Verify4 will rapidly achieve scale and forever change the verifications space. 

Verify4 and Dr. Turner's other sojourns into the private sector were inspired by his commitment to end ""credit invisibility"" (a term he coined) through the use of alternative data. Dr. Turner also collaborated with Experian MicroAnalytics on a prospective alternative credit bureau in East Africa (Financial Identity Risk Management or FIRM), an alterantive data credit score for smallholder farmers in India in partnership with eKutir (Finance and Agriculture Risk Management or FARM); and a cutting edge verifications firm in partnership with FIS Certegy (VIE-ability) 

Dr. Turner currently serves as President and CEO and Founder of the Policy and Economic Research Council (PERC). PERC is a non-profit policy research center focusing upon economic development that has advised governments on five continents. They are global thought leaders on issues of access to finance and credit information sharing.

PERC is committed to outcomes rather than sound bites. PERC only develops solutions to asset building challenges that are sustainable in the market. Using information solutions, PERC seeks to increase financial inclusion by more than any single institution on earth

After serving as a Graduate Fellow at the Columbia Institute for Tele-Information (CITI) at the Columbia Business School in New York City, he was named Executive Director of the Information Services Executive Council (ISEC).

My life’s mission is to help people become happier at work. This has shaped everything I do. Over the past decade, I’ve helped 50,000+ managers at companies like Amazon, Netflix, and Shopify through live sessions, tailored programs, and practical leadership tools.

My journey started over ten years ago, when my first client was 37signals, the creators of Basecamp. I went on to spin off a product they’d developed internally into a tool that became part of Canopy’s broader platform. Since then, I’ve distilled over 50 years of leadership research into frameworks that help leaders navigate complexity and lead with clarity, confidence, and care.

Along the way, I’ve coached leaders at Apple, Uber, and other leading companies through tough moments — team dynamics, performance challenges, scaling pains — and helped them find a way forward. I’ve also spoken at conferences and led leadership trainings around the world. My insights have been featured in Harvard Business Review, CNBC, Inc., and Fortune, and I’ve taught entrepreneurship at Northwestern University, my alma mater.

At Canopy, we help fast-moving organizations upskill their managers through:

🌱 Leadership Development Programs: Live, cohort-based training tailored to your org’s real-world challenges.

💬 Coaching & Advising: 1-1 support for leaders navigating high-stakes, high-complexity moments.

🎤 Speaking & Workshops: Keynotes and interactive sessions that spark clarity and shift culture.

📱 The Canopy App: A leadership improvement app that delivers personalized daily insights, just-in-time tools, and an AI Assistant for deeper support when complex challenges arise.

Outside of work, I paint in oils from my studio in Point Reyes, California, and live in the Bay Area with my husband.

If you’re thinking about how to better support your leaders — or just want to chat about what it means to lead well in fast-moving environments — I’d love to connect.

*Good Energy, a book I wrote with my sister, that has sold 1 million copies in its first 6 months.

In 2025, we will hit the milestone of 1 million patients. Visit Truemed.com to see the brands we work with and see if you qualify for HSA/FSA spending on these healthy items.

Oral book reports. I approached the front of the room, clenched the lectern for support and managed to squeak out five words: ""Good afternoon, my name is."" I completely froze, forgot my name, and never even started the book report! 

Years later I discovered that if one learns how to prepare, practice, and truly connect with listeners, public speaking could be a wonderfully rewarding experience. I studied the best communicators and, though still nervous, I sought every opportunity to speak. Eventually I won several speaking competitions. 

In 1988, Toastmasters International honored me with the title “State's Best Speech Coach” and my company, Simply Speaking, Inc.®, was born. Oglethorpe University in Atlanta hired me to teach their executive presentation skills classes and people from all types of organizations called me to help them improve their communication skills. A decade later, the National Speakers Association honored me with their highest-earned award, the Certified Speaking Professional. The ""CSP"" designation is held by less than 7% of the organization’s 4000 professional speakers.
 
Over the last 30+ years, I've assembled a team of stellar coaches. Together we have helped more than 100,000 people from Savannah to Singapore to develop extraordinary communication skills.

My goal is not to impress you but to impress upon you that no matter where you or your team may be on the spectrum of communication skills, with the right tools, the right coaching methods, and the right support, virtually anyone can be a highly effective and respected communicator.
