With AI power, it plans your day for you. We believe that to achieve success as a team, it's important for each individual to effectively plan their day and adhere to the plan. During the planning stage, 3 main questions need to be answered: “what do I need to work on?”, “how long will it take?” and, “how much time do I have?”.  Planning is important, but not enough by itself for success. Individuals need to maintain their focus throughout the execution of the plan. For ultimate focus, it is essential to minimize the distractions caused by unnecessary messages, switching between unfinished tasks, and losing track of time. With BeforeSunset’s workspace, you can plan your day by reviewing yesterday’s achievements, and unfinished tasks. You can stay on schedule throughout the day by keeping track of time for each task and focusing on one task at a time.  By tracking the time spent on each task, you can ensure that work is progressing as planned and make adjustments as needed. With analytics provided by BeforeSunset close your day by reviewing and reflecting on the progress you made. This detailed daily and weekly analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and plan your future work accordingly. Since work is not all we have, it is important to include personal planning in your day to make sure your daily plan is accurate.

Odynn,"Odynn is an AI-powered, fully modular platform that helps fintechs, banks, card issuers, and travel companies launch embedded travel, loyalty, and rewards programs. Its white-label solution and APIs drive cardholder engagement while unlocking new revenue streams. Think Shopify for loyalty and travel. Current travel loyalty programs offer limited customizations, low engagement, high development cost, and lack of embedded financial features. We are solving the serious customer retention problem and lack of card use in the credit card industry today. There are more banks issuing more rewards credit cards than ever before and there are only a finite number of ways to differentiate your product on the issuing side. Yet there are really only two players on the acquiring side when it comes to travel redemption, Expedia and Booking.com. Banks know travel redemption is the solution to their problem. They just don't know how to do it properly. Odynn makes your cardholders stickier and generates significant revenue in a way that not only benefits your customers but also makes them happy! We know the name of the game is retention. Odynn not only increases retention and reduces churn, but also increases card spend, reduces CAC, provides diversified revenue, and ultimately increases customer lifetime value.  Our B2B partners can:  License our loyalty pricing and/or Traveler DNA APIs for standard SaaS fees Embed our white label loyalty travel portal charged per user Embed our holistic travel portal as a white label, where we pay our partners upwards of 70% of the net travel booking commissions Subscribe to our loyalty pricing data priced per volume",2022,3325000.0,3,2023-01-15,2000000.0,Lakeville,Connecticut,United States,,Anuj Patel|Bruce Garner|John Taylor Garner,30,"""AI-Driven Loyalty and Travel Program Solutions""",https://www.odynn.com/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/odynn/,Active,26.9,17.4,4.2,25,growth,0.85,4.5,4.0,2.1,4.0
