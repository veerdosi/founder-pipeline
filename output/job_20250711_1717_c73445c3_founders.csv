Through all of these experiences, there has been one common theme in creating success, the people.

To bring products that people don’t simply use, but actually connect with, to market takes more than technical skill and great planning, it takes creativity and passion. This is why building a company with the right culture and values is so important to me, and something I always put as a central focus for my senior leadership team.

Earlier in my career, I held engineering, consulting, business development and leadership roles for 12 years working in the telecom and the VoIP space.

The knowledge and experiences I gained from these roles gave me the foundation to jump into cloud in 2015, specifically focusing on AWS.

In 2018 I joined Onica as a Solution Architect and pivoted to fully focus on AI/ML, which was then acquired by Rackspace. This led me to join Hugging Face as an early hire on their monetization team.

After Hugging Face, I joined Roboflow to lead their field engineering and partnership efforts.

In 2023, I had a vision to empower enterprises with industry-specific AI solutions. This idea emerged from my time at Hugging Face where I helped spearhead the monetization team, collaborating with high-profile enterprises.

Growing up in a small town in Southern India, to training to play professional cricket, then changing tracks to become a mechanical engineer, to a long career in tech in Asia and Corporate America, eventually being a founder. 

I am a product of the relationships I built and opportunities I was handed. In the process I built a deep skill stack around fusing business & technology, forging deep relationships & building/scaling high output organizations. 

We are building the most ambitious project of my lifetime—Autonomize AI. Healthcare has no shortage of data. What it lacks is context, actionability, and velocity. Despite a decade of digitization, we’re still struggling to translate information into faster access, affordable care, and radically improved outcomes.

That’s the gap we’re closing. Not with dashboards or more portals—but with compound AI agents that reason, learn, and act across workflows.

We’re not just automating. We’re Autonomizing healthcare.

👉🏽 Autonomizing clinical development by turning slow, static trial operations into dynamic, intelligent workflows that adapt in real time—accelerating drug development at scale.

👉🏽 Delivering precision care by unlocking patient insights from charts, claims, and labs—across silos, across formats—so care teams can personalize decisions, not guess.

👉🏽 Augmenting healthcare professionals with copilots that surface the signal in the noise—enabling smarter, faster, more confident decisions at every step.

👉🏽 Building the world’s healthcare knowledge graph—a living network of context-rich, computable insights that power better decisions across the care continuum.

👉🏽 Equipping every knowledge worker with their own Ironman suit—a personal AI assistant that amplifies their intelligence and reduces their burden, every day.

This is Autonomize AI. A future where every healthcare decision is intelligent, timely, and impactful.
