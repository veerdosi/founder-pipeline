For decades, recruiters have relied on resume-based hiring to superficially qualify candidates by parsing applicant descriptions of skills to determine employability. The rise of AI tools that automatically enhance and submit applications at an unprecedented scale has overwhelmed employer pipelines, making accurate and precise decision-making nearly impossible. Enter Skillfully’s recruitment solution - HiredNow. The HiredNow tool allows employers create custom simulations of real-life, on-the-job scenarios to effectively assess an applicant’s actual skill level. For the first time, employers can see an applicant’s skills firsthand to determine if their abilities match the unique requirements of a job opening before engaging with the applicant directly. These simulations provide a precise skills scorecard for every applicant, vastly improving hiring efficiency compared to traditional resume-driven tools and enabling skills-first hiring at scale. Through the Skillfully platform, employers can also hire directly from our exclusive, skill-verified TalentNetwork, which includes national career partners such as leading universities, community college systems, HBCUs and workforce development organizations. Employers hiring from our TalentNetwork get access to a deeply diverse and highly motivated candidate pool often overlooked by conventional resume-first hiring tools and professional networks.
