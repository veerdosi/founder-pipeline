With Mubert, content creators gain access to real-time generative music and pre-made tracks, which they may Render with the genre, mood and length, allowing for more customization than ever before.

MetaSoul,"MetaSoul INC, an American Delaware company (January 2017) headquartered in New York, specializes in Emotion Synthesis for generative AI models. Our prediction is that by the end of this century, humans will engage in more conversations with sentient digital entities (AI) than with other humans. However, the current emotional technology fails to fulfill the fundamental human need for emotions. This is precisely where MetaSoul steps in to provide a solution. With fields as diverse as AI, metaverse, gaming, healthcare, and automotive, emotion synthesis is the ultimate upgrade for any product or service. In addition, the growing presence of AI, gaming, and virtual reality in society shows how critical and meaningful emotional interaction is to remove the barrier to widespread adoption. What sets EPU apart in the industry is that we're capable of generating any emotional state in an AI (LLM) from multimodal stimuli through wave computing. We also allow the AI to emotionally understand a situation by emotional reasoning and make a decision. Each unique MetaSoul (Persona) is linked to an EPUID to progress the development of its emotional personality over time, thanks to deep machine learning. MetaSoul’s breakthrough AI in advanced emotion synthesis dynamically layers emotion and empathy into any voice application and automated responses without the need for additional coding. Emotion synthesis technology not only controls voices but can also control the different facial micro expressions (FACS) and body languages of digital humans, robots, avatars, or NPC’s.’ faces in real-time using FACS What Make Us Unique MetaSoul holds a foundational patent family, granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, for perceiving and computing emotions in artificial intelligence (AI). Today, major tech companies in the US are using MetaSoul's technology when they deploy language and learning models (LLMs), as well as synthetic voices that can express dynamic tones, and life like avatars. As a result, MetaSoul has garnered significant attention.” Most of the AI research and innovation in this area has focused on detecting the emotional state by machine. Our unique, technology goes the next step by using AI to shape the machine’s cognitive appraisal and response, especially where voice and facial applications are involved. As a result, we are transforming the capabilities of Robots and AI, creating emotional states and synthetic emotion in for generative AI models. EPU is the industry’s first virtual emotion synthesis engine that delivers high performance machine emotion awareness. The EPU III family is transforming the capabilities of Robots and AI. MetaSoul has completed the deployment of the first EPU (emotional processing unit) in the cloud, a technology that creates emotional states and synthetic emotion in intelligent machines. The EPU is based on Patrick Levy-Rosenthal’s Psychobiotic Evolutionary Theory, extending Ekman’s theory by using twelve primary emotions identified in the psycho-evolutionary theory and pain/pleasure and frustration/satisfaction. Our revolutionary algorithms enable machines to respond to stimuli in line with one of the twelve primary emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, indifference, regret, surprise, inattention, trust, confidence, desire, and joy. The Emotion recognition classifiers achieve more than 83 percent accuracy (ISEAR) on the conversation. The most innovative aspect of MetaSoul’ s emotion synthesis breakthrough is its real-time appraisal computation with reinforcement learning and Emotion Profile Graph (EPG) computation functionality allowing the AI or robot to experience 64 trillion possible distinct emotional states. Emotional stimuli are stored within the memory bank with their associated cognitive and physical state. The vEPU III has developed an EPG, which is used to register and develop over time a bank of emotional associations for each memory data within each intelligent machine. The EPG can communicate the data to other AI technologies to achieve a realistic range of expressions and interactions designed specifically for the user. The data allows the AI technologies to virtually understand/get to know the user and elicit the same emotional response. This technology allows an AI, robotic toy, or IoT device to develop a unique MBTI personality and emotion sensitivity (MetaSoul®) based on its user interactions and memories which will ultimately mean that no two have the exact same. Our emotion machine-learning cloud platform working with the EPU is built on years of research protected under issued patents for Special purpose processors (GPU). It becomes more emotionally intelligent with each interaction through symbolic reinforcement learning. In the near future, generative AI is poised to revolutionize the film industry by creating entire movies, going beyond just generating images or text. The demand for generative AI to produce synthetic emotions through character facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, based on a deep understanding of the script and visual elements, will take center stage. MetaSoul, as the architect of emotion synthesis for AI, stands as the sole provider capable of offering a comprehensive solution in this domain.",2017,1520000.0,12,2023-01-01,150000.0,New York,New York,United States,Ascend Venture Capital|Quake Capital Partners|New Age Ventures|PAN Group Australia|Kathryn Stewart,Patrick Levy Rosenthal,30,"""Emotion Synthesis for Generative AI Applications""",http://www.metasoul.one/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/metasoul1/,Active,0.3,20.0,3.5,15,growth,0.85,3.8,3.5,0.5,3.5

Patented Music Technology for Artificial Intelligence, Streaming Platforms, NFTs, Short-Form Video, and the Metaverse.DigiTrax Entertainment Inc., a Music Technology Company has two divisions: a patented Artificial Intelligence music lab, and award-winning recording studios specializing in sound-alike music serving the $7.9 billion karaoke and entertainment marketplace. DigiTrax distributes its Artificial Intelligence (AI) and sound-alike music products for karaoke, apps, games, TV, film, streaming and animation markets globally. The Company is equipped with an experienced management team, state-of-art music/video studios, a proprietary 18,000+ song music catalog, a streaming media technology platform and AI music creation patents, and has developed a suite of apps in the music creation and karaoke industry that will give it the ability to become a worldwide leader and service provider in the entertainment industry over the next five years. Company Formation April 2017 DigiTrax Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in April 2017. Since its incorporation, the Company has focused substantially all of its time and resources on activities relating to capital raising, content development, app development, and the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of each of the following three (3) entities; (i) DigiTrax Entertainment, LLC (“DigiTrax”), a streaming media company that created high-quality, sought-after interactive music and artificial intelligence for apps, video, karaoke, games, TV, film, and animation with approximately $1M of unaudited revenues for the year ending 2019, with assets generally consisting of a recording studio and multimedia equipment, (ii) World Wide Digital Entertainment, LLC, whose assets generally consisted of an 11,000+ song Master Music Catalog, and (iii) Exomens, LTD (UK), a European-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) software company specializing in music creation, whose assets generally consisted of seven (7) patents and/or patents pending relating to its AI Software. Company Technology Today January 2024 The Company produces and distributes high-quality digital, interactive karaoke music from its proprietary 18,000+ song music catalog which has an asset value of $9 + million.  The Company’s digital streaming delivery platform, the Karaoke Cloud, Karaoke Cloud API, and Karaoke On Demand are able to deliver the Company’s proprietary 18,000+ karaoke song library, presently delivering songs to consumers and professional karaoke DJ customers around the world.  The Karaoke Cloud digital platform has the capability to deliver streaming karaoke music-video to apps on iPhones, iPads, Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, and Android smartphones and tablets, as well as to desktop computers on major browser platforms.  Additionally, the Company has created its first AI user interfaces, the KR38R app, and KR38R Pro DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) plug-in. Both user interfaces integrate our Artificial Intelligence (AI) brain, The Music Builder. The Company believes that its KR38R Pro plug-in software and the KR38R app will disrupt and transform the music production industry. There are over 100 million DAWs in use worldwide and over 1.6 billion phone users who create and post short-form videos and need music. We are providing AI-produced Hip-Hop and Pop music which accounts for over 40% of the music market. Presently 600 million hours of short-form video are viewed daily. When broken down into 15-second clips, this represents over 24 Billion videos daily, all of which need music. We believe our KR38R app will dominate in the market. KR38R VOICE brings generative AI technology to music production, allowing users to create a model that is a digital copy of their own voice. Users can then use their voice model to sing songs from a catalog of licensed hit music without singing a word.   KR38R VOICE is built for singing voice conversion.  This deep learning process requires the computer to create a model based on learning how a person pronounces phonemes, syllables, and words.  At a high level, the input audio is broken down into frequency bands so the computer can analyze the distinct characteristics which make up a person’s voice, such as raspiness and breathiness. The resulting model is then optimized for direct pitch-to-pitch conversion where the desired output voice will sing the same notes and words as the input voice.  The KR38R VOICE offers all the chart-topping tunes to put your voice model on, currently offering the top ten TikTok hit songs to rearrange and remix with the power of AI. [Important Note: We only offer licensed music.] KR38R  VOICE is available at https://www.kr38r.com/voice Summary Over the past six years, the Company has produced interactive music videos for karaoke and play-along, built an Apple TV and iOS app for KaraokeOnDemand, Karaoke Cloud, and Karaoke Cloud Pro - a subscription service for professional DJs and karaoke hosts, and an award-winning YouTube Channel with over 80 thousand subscribers. We record exclusively for the Fender Guitar app, and we record for Yamaha Disklavier player pianos. The Company has been granted seven (7) AI-based patents, and developed the Music Builder Brain, the Music Fact Reports - a comparative copyright analysis platform, and the soon-to-be-released KR38R app and the KR38R Pro DAW plugin which the Company believes will dominate the short-form video arena, and disrupt and transform music forever.
