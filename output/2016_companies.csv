These failures equate to billions of dollars in lost opportunity for trial sponsors every year - but more importantly, patients don't have time to wait for us to get it right.  In the digital age, humans cannot physically read and digest every bit of information relevant to a given decision. In addition, almost every organization has what is called 'dark' or 'siloed' data – valuable data that is not being used, or that organizations don’t know they have at their disposal. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the data within a given organization is dark or siloed. As a result, pharmaceutical companies are making important decisions with incomplete information.  ENTER TRIALS.AI - we are on a mission to get effective treatments to patients faster by using artificial intelligence to optimize clinical trial designs for speed and success.  Unlike the current service models out there, we use smart technology to harness vast amounts of data that no human can process – then offer unique insights across therapeutic areas to trial sponsors.
