After 14 years in the tech world - 8 years at Microsoft and 6 years at OpenAI - I led teams, built scalable systems, and helped shape the future of artificial intelligence. In 2025, I co-founded Thinking Machines Lab with Mira Murati and many pioneers in the field of AI to explore the interaction between advanced intelligence and human consciousness. In the same year, I founded Soul Healer, a home office and healing space in Irvine, California, dedicated to the intersection of psychological healing and consciousness growth.

At the same time, I also dabbled in psychotherapy, focusing on psychodynamic and culturally adaptive approaches. I focus on helping Asian Americans, second-generation immigrants, young professionals, and couples facing anxiety, depression, intergenerational trauma, family dysfunction, and perfectionism who are facing and coping with work and entrepreneurial pressures.

My mission is to use systems to understand behavior and use presence to heal the inner world.
Whether I’m coaching founders, guiding therapy clients, or investing in the next startup focused on soul consciousness, I hold this belief

Learning and healing are mutual journeys—a space for both parties to grow together.

I believe: “Systems provide insights into behavior, presence heals experiences; learning and healing are journeys that nourish each other.

Connecting technology, psychology, and culture through deep integration

Investment and focus areas:

Combination of AI and emotional intelligence systems

Mental health of immigrant groups

Psychodynamics and cultural integration

Conscious entrepreneurship and inner growth.

(known simply as Labs [formerly LavLabs]), a superintelligence human-enhancement technology company based in Santa Monica, CA, where he currently serves as Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer, and controlling shareholder.

As a funder, he is the Co-Funder, Managing General Partner, and Chief Investment Officer of Family of Firms, M&D Ventures, Sivad VC, Davis&Davis Venture Partners, Madu Partners, DFD Venture Capital, Elz Ventures and Labs Investor Group, all located in Beverly Hills, CA.

Duránd began his private equity career at just 17, investing in startups, entertainment properties, and music studios across the Midwest. His passion for venture capital and startups inspired him, alongside his wife Maya, to build Madu Fellows, SuperVC Academy, L2s and 2Ls, programs and networks designed to empower education, entrepreneurship and innovation.

His family’s financial, innovative and philanthropic endeavors are anchored by the Sivad Estate Trust (SET), SivadBank (SB), Sivad Wealth Investment Treasury (SWIT) [including Sivad VC and Sivad Fund], Sivad Science Initiative (2SI) [including Sivad Health] and Sivad Family Foundation (2SF) [including Sivad Academy] which focus on preserving and growing generational wealth for the Davises while advancing cutting-edge scientific research.

June 11, 1988) is a Sudanese-Hungarian, American-born omnologist, entrepreneur and investor—self-taught engineer, product and digital designer, chef, artist, music developer, and licensed cosmetologist.

She builds across domains the way others build within them—intuitively, deliberately, and without a blueprint. Maya’s early mastery across industries reflects a native fluency in systems thinking. Her multidimensional work spans science, technology, capital investment, and art.

As a founder, she is the Co-Creator of the Yuhmmy App, the World's 1st Social-Taste Super App, and Co-Founder of its parent company, Labs Companies, Inc. (known simply as Labs [formerly LavLabs Inc.]), a superintelligence human-enhancement technology company based in Santa Monica, CA. Maya serves as Vice Chairwoman, President, Chief Ecosystem Strategy Officer, and is the second-largest controlling shareholder.

She began launching businesses as a teen—studying fashion at FIT in New York for a summer and developing brands in music, fashion, and early digital platforms. She went on to build federal government tech infrastructure through her company PowerBridge, which was later folded into her larger holding entity, Maya Industries Group, and simultaneously entered Washington DC's real estate and hard money lending markets. 

From the start, she moved between fields others thought unrelated, but she understood them as codependent layers of power.

With her husband, Duránd, Maya also stewards a family enterprise whose financial, scientific, and philanthropic architecture spans the Sivad Estate Trust (SET), SivadBank (SB), Sivad Wealth Investment Treasury (SWIT), Sivad Science Initiative (2SI), and Sivad Family Foundation (S2F)—a framework committed to shaping civilization-scale legacy.

Born in Washington DC, raised in Maryland, and having spent parts of her childhood in Sudan, Maya now resides in Beverly Hills, CA.

Independent time is spent with her husband and their 9 children, as well as researching, writing, cooking, and pioneering a new scientific frontier: Omnology, the study of everything.

Built from the ground up using multi-agentic AI, Ciroos offers an AI SRE Teammate that reduces toil, investigates incidents, explains anomalies, and drives autonomous operations across complex, multi-domain environments—all while keeping humans in control.

I bring over two decades of B2B product, GTM, and engineering leadership across cloud, cybersecurity, observability, networking, and enterprise SaaS—spanning startups, scale-ups, and global tech leaders. Previously, I served as VP of Product at Cisco AppDynamics, where I led product and user/information experience across the observability portfolio and played a key role in its integration with Splunk. I’ve also held product and GTM leadership roles at AWS, Gigamon, and Brocade, and have driven over $3B in cumulative profitable bookings.

Throughout my career, I’ve had the privilege of working with exceptional teams to launch category-defining products, lead strategic pivots, and scale high-performing global organizations. At Gigamon, we led the company’s transformation to cloud and security—tripling bookings, adding 2,500+ new enterprise customers, and establishing market leadership in network visibility. At AWS, my team led the launch of CloudWatch Internet Monitor and drove 2–2.5x ARR growth across other services in my portfolio.

My approach to product is simple: obsess over our customers, align what they value with opportunities to innovate, over-communicate, and be relentless about driving outcomes. Then apply learnings, rinse, and repeat. I’m passionate about building high-impact teams and mentoring the next generation of leaders.

The speed, style and nature of the context within which we work has placed new expectations on the performance of salespeople. As such, I believe the achievement of excellence in sales must be approached with a refreshed mind-set. 

For over 30 years, I have taught and achieved sales excellence in large-scale businesses. Working with proven foundational skills and adaptive measures that respond to the changing needs of the market, I empower B2B sales-force teams to address their unique business requirements.

Challenging myself to continually improve, I have built solid foundations related to sales performance. I have worked as VP of Business Development, with over 20 of these years spent with Wilson Learning. In this role I had the responsibility of growing strategic account relationships.  The results however, speak to the outcome of my experience and I enjoyed the privilege of being the top revenue producer for those 20+ years. This title was based on my ability to exceed my sales quota every full year, quadruple the annual quota four times, and double and triple the annual quota across several other years.

Consequentially what I now stand for is Sales Excellence, and this is the essence of our new company - The Valla Group. Working with current and evolving human insights, the latest research, and foundational sales truths, we have architected a sustainable design from which companies can genuinely achieve sales excellence.  Our collective of specialists will enable your sales professionals to function confidently as strategic consultants, as they refine your skills in thinking strategically, operating tactically and driving measurable results.

My journey to this point has been built on a foundation of diverse sales experiences—from individual contributor roles to leadership positions, selling to SMBs and enterprises, through direct and channel partnerships.

For the last 8 years, I've been fortunate to build The Valla Group, a sales methodology and training business that has served hundreds of Fortune 100, 1000, and emerging companies worldwide. We developed a research-based, data-driven approach that transformed how sales teams think strategically, leverage data, and engage effectively with customers. This methodology drove hundreds of millions of dollars in results for our clients.

Working closely with CROs and sales leaders across industries gave me deep insight into what's fundamentally broken in today's GTM approaches and what the future must look like with AI. Now at ShiftUp, I'm applying these insights as we create an intelligence platform that reimagines GTM workflows through AI-orchestrated systems.

I'm passionate about helping organizations unlock growth by supercharging sellers with exactly who to sell to, what to sell them, and how to sell it—shifting cognitive load to intelligent systems and enabling scale across the entire organization.

rPotential,Active,Ayodele Pompey,Founder & CEO | Transforming Education through Technology | Strategic Problem Solver | Inspirational Innovator and Leader | Champion for Every Child’s Potential,https://vc.linkedin.com/in/ayodele-pompey,"Kingstown, Saint George, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines","I was born in the small Caribbean nation of St. Vincent and the Grenadines (SVG), but my journey took root in Barbados when my family moved there when I was just one. From an early age, I excelled in school. I skipped Grade 1 because I was ""too"" smart, only to spend two years in Grade 6 because I was ""too"" young for high school. At eight years old, my entrepreneurial spirit emerged, selling nuts and grapes in my community and at sporting events. This small venture grew into a thriving 6-figure business, but untimely death and separation ultimately thwarted its ongoing success, and I had to return to SVG as a teenager.

Education transformed my life by opening doors I never thought possible. As the first in my family to attend college, I navigated countless obstacles. From overcoming financial challenges to breaking barriers, my educational journey instilled in me a relentless drive and deep-seated passion for ensuring every child can experience the same life-changing power of education. This belief is the cornerstone of my career in education technology.

With 12 years of teaching, 3 years at an examination board, and experience as a college lecturer, university lecturer, and administrator, as well as being a parent of four, I've seen the education system from every angle. I co-founded SmartTerm to revolutionize education through technology, ensuring every child can achieve their full potential. Our suite of tools meets the evolving demands of today's education landscape, and our national implementation is transforming education in SVG and hundreds of other schools across the Caribbean.

As a strategic problem solver and leader, I've reversed losses into profits, transformed underperforming teams into top performers, worked on projects worth up to $300 million, and been named one of the top 5 innovators in the Caribbean. As CEO of SmartTerm, I've grown the company 10-fold over the past 18 months.

My mission is rooted in my own transformative journey through education. Fundamentally, I believe every child is born with potential and purpose, and it's our job to mine that talent and help each child discover their purpose. The current education system, designed for compliance and uniformity, needs to be redefined to achieve that objective. We need a system that adequately develops our greatest asset – our people and their humanity.

When not working, I enjoy playing the guitar, meeting new people at networking events, reading, watching and playing football, serving in my church, and spending quality time with my family.",33,,SmartTerm Limited,Full-time · 4 yrs 10 mos,The DMZ,4 yrs 7 mos,Smartmatic,1 yr 4 mos,Alliance Manchester Business School,MSc.
