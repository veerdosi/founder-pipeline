I knew I wanted to build systems that learn on their own and make physical work smarter, faster, and safer. That obsession led me to Google, where I was fortunate to contribute to pioneering work on planetary-scale AI and autonomous vehicles (now Waymo).

Eventually, I realized there was a bigger frontier no one was touching: autonomy for earthmoving. It turns out, everything we use day to day is either mined or grown. And both require moving earth at scale. 

But the heavy equipment industry has been stuck in the past — since the introduction of hydraulic machines like excavators in the 1800s, earthmoving has seen little of the awesome automation that’s transformed other industries.

So I started AIM.

At AIM, we’re building the world’s first AI-powered platform for heavy machinery. We automate earthmoving, solving for labor shortages, reducing costs, increasing safety, and unlocking the infrastructure upgrades civilization desperately needs. 

From building seawalls to prevent coastal flooding, to creating firebreaks for wildfire defense, to mining the materials that power the renewable economy — this isn’t a ""nice-to-have"" innovation. It’s an essential unlock for the next chapter of human progress.

And the work doesn’t stop on Earth. In the next decade, we’ll need autonomous machines for terraforming, whether it’s rebuilding infrastructure after climate disasters or preparing for off-planet construction.

If you're working on infrastructure, climate resilience, or planetary-scale automation—let’s connect.",35,,CEO and Founder,AIM,Building physical infrastructure,Stealth,Technical Lead,Google,University of Rochester,"Ph.D., Artificial Intelligence",Czech Technical University in Prague,"B.S., Computer Engineering",Research,Computer Science,Machine Learning,Data Mining,Social Network Analysis,4,,Interview on AIM's vision for AI-powered earthmoving machinery; Public statements on autonomous machines improving safety and productivity in mining and construction,0,7.0,positive,,,,Co-recipient of AAAI-11 Outstanding Paper Award for Predicting Disease Transmission from Geo-Tagged Micro-Blog Data; Developed nEmesis system for real-time modeling of foodborne illness using machine learning and crowdsourcing,L4,"Adam Sadilek demonstrates strong technical credentials and senior experience at major tech companies, particularly in AI and autonomous systems.

Savant Labs,Active,Chitrang Shah,Founder @ Savant Labs,https://www.linkedin.com/in/chitrang,"San Carlos, California, United States","Working on bringing analytics and automation together to help analysts and ops teams automate data-driven workflows.

Why? - The answer is rather personal.

As a data-driven leader, I have been hacking my way to extract signals from the noise all my life. And despite having access to cutting-edge data platforms and analytic tools, I found myself running analyses manually in Excel and SQL. Over and over again.

Why? Because these platforms simply couldn’t anticipate the operational questions I would have and provide insights when and where I needed it. The only option was to manually stitch the data and run my own analyses.

At first, I assumed BI tools must have solved this problem… They indeed are good at the type of analytics I wanted to run, but I was disappointed with their automation capabilities for pulling data from and publishing analytics to business apps. That led me to experiment with several automation tools like Zapier. These tools are great at automating repeat tasks but unfortunately can’t support analytics.

What I wanted is one tool that did both analytics and automation, and to my surprise, no such tool existed. It felt as if we convinced ourselves that only engineers need to automate analytics and that business folks like me shouldn’t be involved.

Clearly, that's not true today and we don’t believe it will be true in the future. The modern data stack needs to recognize that I and millions of others like me exist and that there needs to be a tool purpose-built for our needs. That is why we are building Savant, the analytics automation platform for analysts and operations teams.

My mission is to increase transparency, accessibility, and affordability in healthcare.

For me, this is personal. I've experienced the consequences of changing jobs that have disrupted my continuity of care. Employers have too much control over our healthcare. With the rising costs and the lackluster performance of health outcomes, I believe it's time for a change.

At Venteur, we are breaking apart the inefficient one-size-fits-all employer models by leveraging advancements in regulation, data transparency, and artificial intelligence. Our platform enables businesses to provide tax-free money to employees, giving them full control over the $1.6T spent on employer-sponsored healthcare. Our AI-powered decision support empowers employees to choose the doctors, services, and coverage levels they want. I believe individual choice is essential to improve healthcare affordability and enable Americans to live healthier and wealthier lives.

My career passion is to empower individuals with the wisdom of the masses, enabling each of us to live better lives by learning from each other. Venteur is a continuation of this life goal, and each chapter of my career has prepared me for this current mission. I started my career by helping to launch Bing and innovating on search user experiences. At my first startup, Leafully, we engaged Californian residents to reduce energy consumption by 10% over the summer by leveraging data from the newly-built smart grid. In Azure, we developed new machine learning methodologies to more effectively deploy over $15B of capital expenditures towards Microsoft's scaling cloud infrastructure. At my second startup, Optrilo, we further expanded on cloud forecasting, achieving a 1% error on a 12-month horizon.

Peter Adderton is the Founder and CEO of MobileX, the world’s most flexible mobile carrier delivering the ultimate in choice and cost control. Adderton’s visionary approach is rooted in his deep understanding of consumer needs and market dynamics. With MobileX, he introduced the industry's first individually customized wireless plan powered by AI, a move soon followed by the industry’s biggest player. 

Adderton has been fighting to make wireless service affordable and accessible for over two decades. He founded Boost Mobile in 2000 in Australia, which expanded to New Zealand, Canada, and the United States. Boost became one of the fastest-growing wireless brands with annual revenues exceeding $500 million and over five million subscribers. Boost Mobile USA, purchased by Nextel in 2004 and later acquired by Sprint, is now a top mobile brand with over $2 billion in annual revenues. Adderton remains a director and is the largest shareholder of Boost Mobile Australia, where he maintains a hands-on leadership role, ensuring Boost Mobile continues to be a leading youth wireless brand.

In 2011, Adderton co-founded Mandalay Digital (Digital Turbine), growing the business from scratch and ultimately taking it public as a NASDAQ-listed company. Digital Turbine’s technology platform has been adopted by over 30 mobile operators and OEMs worldwide. He also founded Amp’d Mobile, pioneering the concept of a wireless carrier as a mobile entertainment company, earning the “Entertainment Marketer of the Year” award in 2006 by Ad Age.

SignalRank,Active,Keith Teare,Founder and CEO @ SignalRank | Private Markets Indexed,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kteare,"Palo Alto, California, United States","Technologist. Investor. System Builder.

I’m Keith Teare, founder and CEO of SignalRank Corporation, where we’re reimagining how capital flows into venture-backed startups. Our platform is the first to use systematic, machine-learning-based indexing alongside heuristics as features to score and invest in private companies—transforming what was once opaque, illiquid, and relationship-driven into something transparent, accessible, and data-native.

A Career of Building Firsts

Across my career, I’ve been drawn to first principles and frontier problems. In the early internet era, I co-founded:

EasyNet — Europe’s first consumer ISP, bringing broadband access to the UK
RealNames — a pioneering identity and navigation layer for the web
Archimedes Ventures — a seed-stage investment studio backing transformational ideas
As a founding investor in TechCrunch, I helped founder Mike Arrington catalyze the media engine that defined startup storytelling for a generation. That experience reaffirmed my belief that information flow shapes market behavior—and those who control the architecture of insight have leverage.

What I'm Building Now

At SignalRank, we’ve developed the SignalRank Index—the world’s first index offering exposure to systematically selected, venture-backed private companies and a plan to be listed so retail investors can benefit. It’s a data-driven solution to three entrenched problems in venture capital:

Access: democratizing entry to top-tier startup investments
Selection: removing human bias via statistical and ML-based scoring
Liquidity: enabling exits through public listing and index mechanics
We’ve combined Snowflake-scale data infrastructure, AI-powered decision engines, and financial architecture to build a new asset class. This isn’t just fintech—it’s financial infrastructure for the intelligent era.

Revolutionizing Public Access to Private Assets

Unlike traditional venture capital models—where access is gated by networks, LP status, or fund minimums—SignalRank is engineering a breakthrough in public access. By building an index that not only tracks but also owns the underlying private companies, and listing that index on public markets, we make institutional-quality venture exposure accessible to a wider range of investors.

This is a radical step forward: private market returns, delivered with the liquidity and transparency of public markets. No cap tables. No capital calls. Just intelligent, systematic exposure to innovation.",70,,Advisor to Crypto Index,CryptoIndex · Contract,Founder and CEO,SignalRank · Full-time,Investor & Advisor,Miles,University of Kent,"Doctor's Degree, Doctor of the University",University of Kent,"BA (Hons), British Constitution and Sociology",Cross-functional Team Leadership,Strategy,Start-ups,Strategic Partnerships,Product Management,5,,"Published 'That Was The Week' newsletter, podcast and vlog weekly; Writes regularly for TechCrunch; Participated in debates such as 'Will ChatGPT Do More Harm Than Good?'",,7.0,positive,,,,"Founded RealNames, the first multi-lingual addressing system for the Internet, raising over $130 million and achieving a valuation over $1.5 billion; Co-founded EasyNet, Europe's first consumer Internet Service Provider, which went public on AIM in 1996; Founding shareholder of TechCrunch, acquired by AOL in 2010; Pioneered multi-lingual DNS navigation and agreements with Microsoft, Japan, China, Korea; Founded Cyberia, UK's first internet cafe",L7,"Keith Teare demonstrates a clear pattern of founding and scaling multiple successful companies over decades, with notable exits and industry-defining achievements.

DataHub,Active,Shirshanka Das,Co-founder and CTO @ DataHub | Ex-LinkedIn,https://www.linkedin.com/in/shirshankadas,San Francisco Bay Area,"I grew up in a sleepy town in Bihar,  India, where mathematics was practically in the water. My region of the country-bred some of the greatest thinkers of our time, including Buddha, Chanakya, and dozens of literary scholars and philosophers. It was inspiring, yet intimidating….trying to measure up to that level of greatness. 

My mother was a professor, and my father was an engineer who traveled the world. From their experiences, I developed an early interest in learning how diverse communities fit together and build connections. I first got a taste of computers one summer while hanging out on my mom’s campus. When no one was around, I’d slip into the only classroom with an IBM, and teach myself how to build a game. In the end, it didn’t work - but my passion was piqued. 

I earned my Ph.D. in computer science at UCLA - the “birthplace of the internet” - and from there, my career in software engineering has led me to some incredible companies, including PayPal, Yahoo, and LinkedIn. I spent 10 years navigating the complex data challenges that came up as LinkedIn grew to become one of the most influential platforms in the world. I was the lead engineer and technical architect behind LinkedIn's data platform, responsible for data and metadata management, including key projects like GDPR - with a team of 150 developers. 

As I learned more about the challenges that came with complex data ecosystems, I developed DataHub, an open-source metadata platform that helps address issues that arise when managing and leveraging data at scale. The more the platform grew - the more we relied upon it at LinkedIn - the more I knew I was onto something.

In 2021, I worked with my former colleague and now business partner Swaroop Jagadish to launch Acryl Data, an enterprise version of DataHub. We brought together our unique experiences supporting data infrastructure at some of the leading companies in the industry to offer a developer-first platform for metadata management. In three years, we’ve raised $30 million+, and are helping clients like PayPal, Notion, Zendesk, and others do amazing things with their data.

For nearly two decades, I have been focused on the needs of stakeholders-- health consumers (formerly known as patients), payers, manufacturers, and providers-- to support the development of a broad range of therapeutic and diagnostic products.

Currently, I serve as President and Co-Founder of Homeward, a technology-enabled healthcare provider delivering care to those who don’t have it. Homeward is focused on improving access to high-quality, affordable comprehensive care in rural communities. 

Previously, I joined Livongo Health in 2014 shortly after its inception, inspired by the mission to empower people with chronic conditions to live better and healthier lives. We delivered the market’s first integrated hardware-software-service products focused on solving the hassles of consumers living with conditions like diabetes, hypertension, and more. I’ve led product management, design, product marketing, and business development over the course of my time at Livongo, and we took the company public at a $3.5B valuation in 2019. In 2020, we were acquired by Teladoc Health for over $18B. After the acquisition, I assumed the role of Chief Product Officer at Teladoc Health, with responsibility for all of our telemedicine and chronic condition product lines, and most interestingly, the unique possibilities that emerge at the intersection of the two. 

For the past 20 years, I’ve developed disruptive healthcare technology products across a wide range of domains and markets: advanced wearables for the consumer market; absorbable implantable devices for the interventional device market; minimally-invasive cardiac surgery tools for the surgical medical device market; and microfluidic drug discovery tools for the pharmaceutical market. I’ve had the honor of working with entrepreneurial and scientific luminaries including Bob Langer and George Whitesides.

I completed my Masters and Bachelors degrees at MIT and have 10 issued patents.

Specialties:
* Executive leadership in companies from seed stage through $30B public market cap

At the beginning of my career, I was mostly interested in digital signal processing and computer arithmetic. The main discovery that I have found  in 1993, the so-called double base number system, has led to very promising VLSI designs for ultra low-power digital filters, with applications in hearing aid instruments.

Slightly later, I started to work on cryptographic algorithms, and the same idea - properly modified - has led the fastest elliptic curve point multiplication algorithms and widespread uses in real world cryptographic systems.

I also developed an alternative technique for image compression applications, based on encoding the elements of the DCT matrix with algebraic integers. The main designs have been used in PillCam systems for low-power and low-area applications.

2024: Launched Socialsonic — helping creators build personal brand on LinkedIn from strategy to execution
2025: Built AI Agents for SEO and Marketing
2025: Pioneering GEO — the biggest opportunity since SEO

What drives me:
→ Helping brands win in AI search before it's too late (the window is closing fast)
→ Building the ""Ahrefs for AI Search"" — because you can't optimize what you can't measure
→ Making marketing teams 10x more productive through automation
→ Using AI to preserve and share cultural wisdom (BhagavadGita.AI)

Currently obsessed with:
- Cracking how AI platforms decide which brands to recommend
- Training AI agents to think and execute like marketing strategists
- Making entire marketing workflows 10x more efficient with AI automation

We started building in AI when it wasn't cool. Now we're defining how AI will transform marketing departments of the future.

Since age 15, I had been an active competitive programmer representing the country at international math and computer science competitions. I did my Ph.D. at Oxford Robotics Institute and spent summers at Google, Facebook, Microsoft Research, and MetaMind (acquired by Salesforce).

I started two startups in the space:
- Blue Vision Labs (2016-2018) developing large-scale localisation and mapping (SLAM) cloud backend for AR and robotics (acquired by Lyft).
- Coram AI (2021-) developing video AI systems for businesses.

I also served as a Head of Research at Lyft Level 5 self-driving and Woven by Toyota where I led teams building ML planning and simulation technology for self-driving cars.

Gratitude.

I cracked one of India's hardest tech schools, wrote code for Microsoft, and scaled the corporate ladder at Cisco, eventually leading a team of 1000+ as one of the youngest Senior VPs.

But here's the kicker: I still felt something was missing.

That's when I had an epiphany. Great business communication is the game-changer, yet the secrets are not well understood and inaccessible to many. So, why not democratize it?

My wife Deepti kicked off this vision with a services company called PREZENTIUM, turning draft presentations into masterpieces overnight. The company exploded—serving 100+ enterprise clients, validating our concept, and gathering valuable metadata.

With our findings, I quit my 7-figure Cisco gig, invested $1M of our own money, and founded Prezent.ai. A gamble? Sure. But, guided by Jeff Bezos' ""Regret-Minimization Framework,"" it was a no-brainer.

And the journey has been spectacular. We raised a $4.3M seed round, and snagged a $20M Series A right before the Ukraine crisis hit. Now serve 100+ Fortune 2000 companies with over $40M raised.

But there's more. Beyond business, my vision is holistic. I aim to be a ""Complete Man""— integrating my roles as a CEO, husband, son, father and spiritual being. Because what's the point of success if you can't be whole?

My current success metrics:

→ Lived the American Dream, from $800 in my pocket to a house in Los Altos, CA.
→ A loving family that supports my dreams (son Sameer (12), daughter Deeya (8)).

Sometimes the products I work on actually are great, some times not so much. :)  But I keep trying and learning.   

As a founder of Bito, I lead a team focused on creating AI-powered agents specifically designed to make developers’ lives easier and their work more impactful.

Our flagship product, an AI Code Review agent, reduces code review time by up to 50%, allowing developers to focus on what matters most: writing great code and innovating.

With a background in launching and scaling companies, including creating PubMatic, the first-ever Supply Side Platform in digital advertising (a category with >$10B market value), I bring a proven track record of pioneering solutions that create long-lasting value. 

My career began with a passion for building—from my first startup during college to a series of ventures focused on technology that changes how people work.

Bio (see curtisnorthcutt.com):
I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at MIT,  advised by quantum computer inventor (and friend) Isaac Chuang. Before that, I was awarded the NSF Fellowship and MIT Morris Joseph Levin Masters Thesis Award for my work at MIT. I also TA'd graduate machine learning (6.867) at MIT. Before that, I graduated as valedictorian from Vanderbilt University (2009-2013) where I majored in math and CS and was awarded the Barry M. Goldwater National Scholarship.

My work spans the theory and applications of AI including uncertainty quantification and augmenting human capabilities. I invented confident learning and founded Cleanlab, a company that makes AI work reliably by curating the knowledge bases that power the AI systems. Before that, I created the CAMEO cheating detection system used to validate certificates in MITx and HarvardX online course teams. I am grateful to learned a ton working at places like Google AI, Oculus Research, Facebook AI Research, Amazon AI, Microsoft Research, NASA, MIT, and Harvard.

Growing up below the poverty line in rural Kentucky, I felt the glass ceiling of limited human and monetary resources. The ladder of opportunity often rises from prosperity rather than ability. My ladder was my education. Education led to exposure, summer programs, scholarships, and eventually opportunity. Everyone deserves access to quality educational resources – this underlies my motivation to pursue research that democratizes education and augments human learning and capabilities. This is why I spent my early years at MIT inventing the CAMEO cheating detection algorithm used to validate MITx and HarvardX certificates for open-access, free online courses, called MOOCs. And ultimately founded and continue to build companies that fill labor gaps needed for AI technology to empower people and the world we live in.",30,,CEO & Co-Founder,Cleanlab,CTO & Co-Founder,ChipBrain,Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),7 yrs 10 mos,Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.), Computer Science",Massachusetts Institute of Technology,"Master of Science - MS, Electrical Engineering and Computer Science",Algorithms,Machine Learning,Research,Computer Science,Data Analysis,5,MIT Morris Levin Thesis Award; NSF Fellowship; Goldwater Scholarship,Speaker at Data Council AI conference; Speaker at ODSC conference; Speaker at AI User Conference,,8.0,positive,,,,"Co-founded Cleanlab in 2021, which raised $30 million in equity funding",L4,"Curtis Northcutt demonstrates strong technical credentials and proven operational experience, fitting the L4 'Proven Operators' category.

Secured my first role with Carlisle Archaeology Unit in 1981 – site labourer – but quickly got involved in excavation, finds recording, section drawing, photography and surveys on various rescue digs in Carlisle. Following a year doing archaeology at Newcastle University and disillusioned with the lack of fieldwork left to take up a career with Ordnance Survey (OS). Starting as a field assistant in 1982, progressed to land surveyor then following HND and MSc studies, ended up in R&D on digital mapping and address products. 

Took up GIS Analyst role with Central Regional Council in 1993, then into the innovative shared GIS service, Forth Valley GIS. Left in 1998 to become GIS Manager at West of Scotland Water, and following 4 years of innovative GIS development work, progressed to Corporate Asset Systems Manager. 

Brief stint as a pre sales consultant with OS in 2001, then back to head up Forth Valley GIS in 2002. In 2007 led the spin out of the shared GIS service to an arms length company as Chief Executive and rebranding to thinkWhere in 2013. Over that time, held key roles on national programmes covering addressing and e-Planning as well as consulting roles on GIS strategies at local, regional and national levels.

Currently enthused by the richness of opportunities presented by open data, open source GIS technologies, web mapping and cloud computing. Really excited to be working with the strong talented team at thinkWhere on theMapCloud, our new geospatial data platform, and delivering leading web GIS solutions for clients in the UK and internationally at what has to the most exciting time for GIS so far.

And yes, still interested in archaeology, local history and as much road cycling as I can pack in to keep me sane.

Aligned,Active,Gal Aga,CEO @ Aligned | Don't Sell; offer 'Buying Process As A Service',https://il.linkedin.com/in/galaga,"Tel Aviv District, Israel","I lead an exceptional team dedicated to transforming how B2B sellers and buyers work together.

With 17 years in the B2B SaaS sales game, scaling from 1M$-$100M in ARR as CRO, VP Sales, and Sales Director, I've experienced firsthand the challenges that Sales & CS teams face with deals/projects: A spaghetti bowl process, with many stakeholders and moving parts to control.

We realized:
1. Sales is complex since buying is more
2. We live in a buyer-led era, where 95% of buying takes place when sellers are not in the room

The aha moment:
↳ Top AEs don't Sell, they offer Buying Process As A Service; focus on enabling buyers to buy and sell internally
↳ Sales enablement isn't enabling sales if it's not enabling buyers; We must shift to buyer enablement instead

This led us to build Aligned:
↳ A Digital Sales Room & Client Portal that will reshape selling & buying; enable all reps to manage deals and onboard customers effectively. A new and better way to work.

We are building a new category: negotiation-as-a-service. Where debt isn’t just managed, it’s intelligently negotiated. By consumers. On their terms. In minutes.

After years in regulatory compliance and $250k of personal debt repaid, I knew the problem wasn’t budgeting. It was power.
Power to understand. To negotiate. To act.

Vera’s mission is systemic: we’re bringing AI into debt recovery for consumers, not just creditors. We’ve built a beta that reads any debt letter and decodes negotiation options instantly. And we’re now raising our first round to scale.
Our go-to-market is B2B2C: councils, employers, and institutions with high-volume debt portfolios who want ethical, AI-powered consumer solutions.

We’re simultaneously shaping the regulatory landscape through our white paper, executive forums, and FCA sandbox submission.
I also advise executive teams on AI fluency, strategy, and category innovation. My work intersects financial regulation, AI transformation, and cultural systems change.

If you’re an investor, institution, or operator shaping the future of finance, we should talk.

Datorios,Active,Asaf Cohen (Pizzer),Co-founder & CRO @ Datorios,https://il.linkedin.com/in/pizzer,"Tel Aviv District, Israel","My career took a strong course very early on. I was rapidly transported into the complex world of Israel's National SIGINT Unit (8200), rising from a young recruit to a commander who held responsibility for 1000s of soldiers within the unit as well as many externally — even in different corners of the world. During my tenure in these critical roles, I absorbed the ins & outs of the deep + complex worlds of #AI, #BigData #DataAnalysis & #Cyber. I further established a firm power & drive to succeed that is accompanied by the attributes of focus, dedication & decisiveness that allowed me to consistently conquer any given mission at any given time. This past year, I concluded my military career as the Deputy Commander of the entire 8200 unit. 

My experience is all-encompassing, allowing me to lead with confidence in tech & business arenas. I have effectively managed divisions towards definitive goals through holistic, end-to-end approaches, charged with executive capabilities and decision-making skills that allowed operations to flow seamlessly. From creation to execution, I have endured the successful completion of fully functioning product road maps that deliver expected results & even propel growth. These productive outcomes arise due to my unique combination of tech & operational proficiency, but also from attributes that I believe are the underlying momentum of my core expertise: innovation + creativity. 

Due to my unprecedented exposure to a challenging world, I have honed the skills of the above and created a fast forward-thinking mindset. This mode of operation provides me with ability to change things up by thinking differently and thus doing differently. To me, a roadblock is not seen as an obstacle but rather as an often fun opportunity to make adjustments and conquer with a more data-driven, innovative –  and creative methodology.

As an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics at Harvard Medical School, I direct a research lab pioneering multi-modal medical data integration and understanding in medicine. I am also Co-Founder and Scientist at a2z Radiology AI, a company developing a comprehensive diagnostic imaging system capable of analyzing hundreds of clinical findings in each scan—far beyond the narrow scope of current tools. By covering the full breadth of radiology, we aim to ensure that no disease goes undetected.

My journey in AI began early - I started research as a first-year undergraduate at Stanford in 2012 working on autonomous driving, and then was fortunate to be accepted into Stanford's Computer Science PhD program at 19, where I worked with pioneers in artificial intelligence, Andrew Ng and Percy Liang. During my doctoral studies, I focused on developing AI systems that could match and complement physician-level expertise across critical medical tasks. This work led to several breakthrough papers, including systems that could detect arrhythmias from ECGs and interpret chest X-rays at the level of experienced doctors. The impact of this research opened doors early in my career, and at 25, I was selected to join Harvard Medical School as an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Informatics. In 2024, I co-founded a2z Radiology AI, driven by the conviction that true radiologist-level AI could be unlocked and would redefine the future of disease detection.

I have published more than 100 academic articles garnering more than 35,000 citations, including in Nature, NEJM, and Nature Medicine. I have written in the The New York Times, and been featured in CBS, NPR, and Financial Times.

I lead with a mission: to help one million people live healthier, safer, and more dignified lives by 2030—by aligning healthcare leaders with proven innovations that produce measurable outcomes.

As CEO of Supply Chain Butler and CRO of OK2StandUP, I work with executives accountable for millions of covered lives—leaders navigating the urgent demands of value-based care, litigation risk, compliance mandates, and workforce burnout.

We don’t sell products—we deliver outcomes.
Through strategic partnerships, we eliminate friction, accelerate time-to-value, and produce measurable results across care delivery, reimbursement, and operational performance.

At OK2StandUP, I lead national deployment of a AI-driven predictive software-as-a-medical device platform—achieving 95% accuracy in real-time prediction and enabling proactive intervention across hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and home care.

We believe in solving problems that matter—partnering with the right people, at the right time, to protect patients, empower providers and caregivers, and drive transformation across the healthcare ecosystem.

We support:
• Payors, reinsurers, and self-funded plan underwriters
• IDNs, health systems, hospitals, and community-based providers
• Post-acute and extended care organizations (LTACs, SNFs, ALFs, home health, hospice)

We connect these organizations with:
• Predictive AI for fall prevention, readmission reduction, and litigation mitigation
• Real-time patient monitoring, care coordination, and wound care programs
• Referral optimization and care transition solutions like Orbit HC
• Interoperable data infrastructure from XChange—reducing IT delays and accelerating deployment
• Non-emergency transport from Caliber Care—improving safety and reducing cost
• Direct-to-provider wound care from Gentell—eliminating allocation risks and improving outcomes
• Remote patient monitoring via VyTrac and innovative bladder care via UR24 Technologies
• AI-powered platforms for documentation, cognitive health, and chronic care management

Our approach is fast, proven, and execution-ready. We shorten the gap between decision and deployment—helping leadership teams realize ROI in weeks, not quarters. By eliminating unnecessary layers and enabling direct access to solution leaders, we simplify complexity and drive enterprise-wide results.

If you’re responsible for outcomes, compliance, and care quality, let’s connect.

Numbers Station,Active,Colin Caird,"Founder, Numbers Station",https://ca.linkedin.com/in/colin-caird-a5b311117,Greater Ottawa Metropolitan Area,"I’ve spent 25 years in cybersecurity across both public and private sectors, holding roles at every level — from deeply technical IC positions disrupting nation-state threat actors to senior leadership posts shaping security strategies for enterprises and governments. I’ve spent my career tackling threats most people never even see — from corporate breaches to state-sponsored surveillance campaigns. But then it got personal. After being directly targeted by mobile spyware, I saw firsthand how ineffective traditional mobile security solutions were. No existing solution could stop or detect the attack. It was only by chance that I discovered it at all.

That led me to found Numbers Station — to finally build a real mobile security and threat detection solution, one that isn’t rendered ineffective by app “sandboxing” or limited to surface-level checks.

Existing MDM, MTD, and so-called “mobile EDR” tools from major vendors simply can’t access the system-level data required to perform true threat detection on mobile operating systems — and I set out to address that. There’s a reason you’ve never heard of any existing mobile security solution detecting NSO Group’s Pegasus and similar — they simply can’t.

Our tools dig deep, analyzing system diagnostics to uncover anomalies at the process and thread level that indicate compromise.

We don’t rely on dated and ineffective public Indicators of Compromise (IoCs); instead, we use automated detection of anomalies followed by manual review. Real humans. Real analysis. For iOS, our baseline of “normal” that we compare against to find anomalies has been generated from scanning over 1M system diagnostic samples from over 50K unique devices. Outside of Apple, no one has analyzed as many iOS devices as us. It’s protection that works — even against the latest and most advanced nation-state mobile spyware. We’re closing the gap that MDMs and mobile EDRs still leave wide open.

We’re not exaggerating when we say our solutions protect the personal and official devices of leadership in NATO member governments. These governments understand the limits of MDM, MTD, and “mobile EDR” — and they knew they needed something better.  Our solutions have detected real-world, active nation-state compromises targeting government clients — attacks that also bypassed traditional network defenses and fooled Zero Trust identity systems, including MFA and device trust indicators.

If you’re securing mobile environments, supporting high-risk user groups, or just tired of mobile security products that don’t actually protect — let’s talk.",25,,Founder,Numbers Station,,,,,University of Victoria,"Bachelor of Applied Science (B.A.Sc.), Computer Science (with Business and Co-op Options)",,,Mobile Security,Network Security,Threat & Vulnerability Management,Threat Analysis,Unified Threat Management,0,,,0,0.0,neutral,,,,,L3,"The founder demonstrates extensive technical and management experience in cybersecurity spanning 25 years, with significant expertise in both public and private sectors.

I started my career at Genesys in 1996, the world’s #1 omni channel customer experience platform where I managed channel partnerships through an IPO and acquisition by Alcatel. I would then go on to launch a startup digital guide for event planners, which quickly collected thousands of clients through management of business ops, partner platforms, content partnerships, and vendor marketing.

In 2007 I joined the Glam/Mode Media team as the Director of Publisher Operations, where I worked with more than 10,000 publishers negotiating partnership agreements and licensing video content. I became a Vice President in 2014 and then Senior VP of Partner Strategy/Operations the following year, where I am responsible for sourcing, negotiating and optimizing the ongoing value of strategic partnerships and creating, launching and growing new lines of business for the company.

A Silicon Valley native, I also use my entrepreneurial spirit to lead business development efforts for Think Women – A Future Youth Records and V.I.N.Y.L. Campaign (Voices for Inspiring and Nurturing Youth Leadership).

At Scalestack, we’re building the Autonomous Revenue Engine - an enterprise-grade orchestration and activation system powered by AI agents that clean, enrich, and prioritize data at scale.

Not another dashboard.
Not a tool to babysit.
Scalestack disappears beneath your stack, and runs the motion for you.

Our customers include MongoDB, Redis, Typeform, and Remote teams with complex GTM motions and data-heavy workflows that need to run without breaking.

We help these teams move from static scoring and manual ops to dynamic, always-on targeting—with clean, structured data and workflows that just work.

Some results I’m proud of:
	•	MongoDB moved from once-a-year profiling to dynamic territory design
	•	Harness & Typeform route and prioritize leads in real-time, based on live ICP and buying signals
	•	All of our customers now align sales and marketing around motion—not dashboards

Our sweet spot is mid-market and enterprise orgs (Series B+, PE-backed, or public) with 200+ employees, high inbound velocity, and RevOps leaders ready to replace workflows with systems.

Before Scalestack, I led GTM strategy at AWS, supporting hundreds of scaling startups. I’ve founded and exited two companies (Zero9 and Instal), advised a few others, and survived some spectacular failures along the way. (MIT gave me the frameworks—I earned the scar tissue.)

He established the first cloud-based, text to speech platform, iSpeech, (2007) which brought to market DriveSafe.ly (2009).  This was the first app to dictate text messages aloud (CES Best Mobile App 2011, Mashable Best Mobile App 2010). He went on to create iSpeech Home (2012), a connected home precursor of Amazon Alexa and Google Home.

Both an early and follow-on investor in multiple tech startups including Andreessen Horowitz-backed, ReadyPlayerMe, Heath has lectured on the social impact of artificial intelligence, bootstrapping and speech technology at many industry conferences including TEDx, NJTC, CTIA, AI World Forum and Mobile Voice Conference.

Heath built an enormously robust app portfolio from scratch, both developing and acquiring nearly 100 apps and exiting over a dozen. He's had iOS apps in the Top 50 and has continuously built technology lightyears ahead of its time.

At the core of these accomplishments sits a demonstrable love for the power of voice; be it human or synthetic. This fervor sparked the inception of Voice.ai, and reverberates throughout the business and ignites excitement with both colleagues and communities alike.

If that's the case, maybe you're facing these challenges :


→ Your LTV rates suffer because your customer engagement is extremely low.

→ You hardly upsell to your customers and your AOV rates take a big hit.

→ You have no personalized campaigns to capture customer interest.

→ You're unable to initiate any repeat customer purchases.


What happens next?

Your sales never change.

If you made $500k a year in 2022.

You're still making that much or close to that, and your ROI never doubles, triples, or quadruples, etc.

Let me tell you an interesting stat though!

Brands that use video in their marketing and customer interactions are 49% more likely to grow their revenue than those that don’t.

And with AI taking the world by storm, brands are quickly adapting to this new trend of using personalized AI-generated videos to interact with their customers in a way that's never been seen before.

I couldn't understand why shopping had lost the personal touch that came with going into a store and talking with the owners and employees.

When my co-founder and I started Maverick in 2021, we wanted to bring this personal touch online forever.

🤧 Old-fashioned Ecom brands do this:

❌ Have barely any interaction with their customers and no personalized video content.

❌ Create custom videos by manually recording for 100s of customers.

❌ Spend tons of time on video creation that you could be using to generate revenue for your business.

🤩 Brands that use Maverick do this:

✅ Record a single video once (literally).

✅ Get personalized AI generated video content based on the name of each customer.

✅ Surprise and delight their customers and turn them into brand evangelists.

No one’s saying no to this 🤷‍♂️.

We’ve been able to achieve these amazing results for our customers:

🔺️3X higher email engagement.

🔺️On average 20% more repeat purchases.

🔺️Helped Ava Estell’s skincare brand achieve 40X more ROI, a 45% clickthrough rate and a 12% reply rate.

If you choose Maverick today, I'm sure you’ll be able to achieve similarly awesome results.

TRaiCE,Active,Geetha Ramaswamy,CTO & co-founder of TRaiCE,https://www.linkedin.com/in/gee-ramaswamy,"Schaumburg, Illinois, United States","I am a strong believer in this famous quote, which gave me the purpose to build my companies.
 “Ideas are easy. Execution is everything. It takes a team to win.” ~ John Doerr

From my experience, product engineering is a delicate balance between committed scope, effort, and available resources. It depends on an efficient engineering team with an acumen for strong execution to meet deadlines and deliver milestones on time, per scope, and on budget.

My passion for building products, leading engineering teams, learning new technologies that can be applied to solve industry problems, and talent for execution were the winds that evolved the software engineer in me into a business owner.

I co-founded Menerva Software (https://menervasoftware.com) in August 2016, where our niche was in product engineering, developing data analytics products for our customers automating their workflows, and deriving insights from their own data to make business decisions.  

Fast forward to 2019, the idea for TRaiCE was seeded by one of our Menerva advisors, Joe Kurian, who is in credit risk related to commercial lending. When doing a postmortem of losses (line of credit loan defaults) in his financial institution, he found that many credit losses were preventable and digital data hid red flags for these businesses. If only financial monitoring was combined with digital monitoring, they could have detected early warning signs months in advance and easily prevented losses! Our call to action was how could we aid financial institutions to tap into the power of unstructured non-financial data sources and prevent losses? Current portfolio monitoring systems largely ignore unstructured data, we addressed this gap by building TRaiCE (https://traice.io). 

TRaiCE was officially launched as a company in April 2021. TRaiCE is a B2B SaaS Early Warning System that monitors Business Risk by computing a 24x7 digital index from the business' public information from the internet, and an early warning risk index combining financial metrics with this digital index. 

About me: I have over 25 years of experience developing software and architecting platforms using various technologies working with enterprise, product, and data applications. My key focus areas are the architecture and implementation of data science, engineering and analytics solutions, and products that leverage AI/ML algorithms applied in an explainable manner to solve industry problems.

At 15, I went to university and became a laser physicist. I started my first business at 16 while being a full-time student and working in a lab. At 17, I launched my second business, which allowed me to start traveling the world on my own (I’ve now visited 50+ countries). I began my corporate career at 18 as a senior consultant in commercial real estate, and at 19, I went to business school to study strategic management. During my career, I helped build offices for Google and other major enterprises. I became a business development director and led teams in the office furniture industry.
At 25, I founded my own innovative office furniture company. In just one year, we grew from $0 to $2M in revenue, signing global clients like Cisco, Total, and Atlas Copco. Within 3 years, we launched our first furniture line in addition to acting as a dealer. Five years in, we landed the biggest project of the year. By year 10, we had produced 85 furniture collections, scaled a team of 100+, completed 750+ projects (including ones up to 5 million square feet), earned 19 “Project of the Year” awards, “Product of the Year,” and I was named EY Businesswoman of the Year.

As we designed cutting-edge spaces for Fortune 500 companies, we recognized a major gap: there was no intelligent system to manage them. That’s how inspace was born.

inspace is an artificial intelligence company transforming how people work across office spaces - whether in person, hybrid, or remote. We put employees at the center of everything, whether it’s simplifying desk booking, room scheduling, visitor management, or remembering their favorite desk, lunch order, or how they like their coffee. Our platform provides visibility into who is in the office and when, improving collaboration.  Our AI Workplace Agent acts as a proactive teammate - boosting productivity by 32% and reducing lease costs by up to 77% through automation, real-time data, and seamless workplace orchestration.

By creating an employee-centric experience and achieving the highest adoption rate on the market, we maintain up to 99% accuracy in insights and can inform workplace leaders about the best decisions to make.

Unknot.id was born from a deep commitment to the belief that meaningful, privacy-conscious intelligence can be extracted from everyday sensors—and that spatial awareness, when done right, can transform how people and machines move through the world. Our universal location platform extracts high-fidelity insights from noisy COTS sensor data—blending movement, context, and identity—to power applications ranging from operational awareness and emergency response to fraud detection and indoor navigation.

Before founding Unknot.id, I led Research and Innovation at United Technologies (now Raytheon Technologies), where I focused on advancing frictionless security and privacy through applied AI. In roles spanning Principal Investigator, Cybersecurity Advisor, and Strategic Technologist, I helped shape technical roadmaps, advised C-suite leadership, and led national security initiatives across government and industry. As co-founder of the Security and Privacy group, I directed multi-million-dollar programs funded by DARPA, DOE, DHS, and NSF—efforts rooted in interdisciplinary collaboration and long-term impact. Throughout, I remained committed to mentoring emerging talent and fostering innovation at the edge of AI and cyber-physical systems.

That work led to breakthroughs across domains. Collaborations with Harvard Medical School, Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and the University of Rochester developed an advanced mobile-based digital phenotyping for early detection of TBIs and neurodegenerative conditions under DARPA sponsorship. At DHS S&T, I contributed to the development of a mobile access system that used human behavioral signals instead of passwords. With the Department of Energy and UIUC, I helped shape self-healing distributed energy infrastructures that respond to anomalies in real time. Work with IBM improved mobile malware detection by fusing static, dynamic, and metadata signals. A collaboration with Johns Hopkins, supported by NSF, explored audio-sensor-based alternatives to CAPTCHA to counter deepfakes and bots.

I hold a PhD with the highest academic achievement award and an MS in Computer Engineering, with specializations in AI, cybersecurity, and statistics.

Built for a post-iOS14 world, Recast requires no user tracking, making it a long-term solution for effective marketing. 

WHAT OUR CLIENTS SAY

“Recast helped our brand work through unchartered territories by modeling out our marketing activations during the pandemic. The team is nimble, smart as a whip, and eager to tackle more challenges to improve revenue generation and/or efficiencies.”
Neil Heckman | Director, Acquisition Marketing at Away

Marjorie Chelius | Head of Marketing at Mockingbird

Since launching in brick-and-mortar sales channels, Harry’s struggled to produce a consistent method by which to measure omni-channel ROI of our marketing activities. With Recast, we’ve been able to produce omni-channel measurement comparable to what we previously only had for DTC.

RESULTS

-Enabled a rapidly growing consumer company to increase their blended ROI from 0.7X to 1.3x by identifying improvements across 60% of their paid media mix.

-Supported a DTC company transition from growth to profitability with our model budget optimizer that recommended a spend reduction of 36% and a change in mix totaling 17% of spend. The result was only a 22.5% decrease in conversions, meaning a 21% improvement in efficiency

Recast,Active,Andy Meikle,"Empowering businesses to sell their media on a pay-per-view basis directly to consumers anywhere online, with instant affiliate revenue distribution | Founder & CEO @ Recast | Co-Founder @ Sportlobster",https://uk.linkedin.com/in/andrewmeikle,United Kingdom,"In short, I'm passionate about helping rights holders and media companies reach and monetise larger audiences more effectively.

I founded Recast to address this. 

- Instant content distribution and monetisation of global and younger audiences.
- Audience reach with zero marketing costs and athlete/influencer incentives.
- Reach, engagement, loyalty / rewards, data capture, and monetisation in one solution.

How:

→ Easy to integrate, self-serve fintech platform for media owners
→ Solution includes RecastPay, a Universal Micropayment Wallet, with a built-in Affiliate and Content Syndication engine, and Data capture tools.

The longer version:

In 2018, I decided to use my knowledge from my first sports tech venture (Sportlobster), to change the way rights holders monetise content. 

- Frustrated by the fragmented media landscape.
- Saw challenges / costs involved in monetising media.
- Wanted to create something fairer for fans and more profitable for media owners.
- Not just for sports, but for the wider media landscape.

I recognised there was a better way to:

→ Facilitate an exchange of value between rights holders and their fans.
→ Leverage technology to create scalable revenue streams.
→ Achieve this while giving fair and flexible access to fans. 

Recast addresses these needs through:

1. A self-serve platform that enables media owners to sell their content at a price of their choosing, directly to any consumer, anywhere in the world on any website/platform.

2. RecastPay, a universal micropayment wallet that consumers can top up or earn value into, giving them one-click access to content, turning every view into ppv.

3. Our payment platform instantly distributes revenue directly to all associated parties, including media owners, talent or participants, including individuals who have promoted the media through their social networks (such as athletes or influencers) and affiliate platforms authorised by the media owner to host the content.

So, if you want to:

→ Monetise your media more effectively
→ Engage your fans with meaningful interactions
→ Simplify transactions and capture valuable data
→ Reach your audience wherever they are

As an Ex-Microsoft Data Scientist and a Trusted Advisor to Fortune 500 CIOs, I now help enterprises build Private, Cloud-Based Agentic Platforms that unify Data Lakes, Generative AI, and Deterministic Models—turning complexity into clarity, and data into outcomes.

I’m also the Founder of Super AI, a pioneering company that builds enterprise-grade AI platforms where business leaders can ask questions in plain English and get insights from structured and unstructured data—instantly, securely, and without technical barriers.

I help organizations move beyond dashboards and into the era of AI Shadows—where each team has its own intelligent assistant trained on their business logic and data.

This approach is already delivering real impact:

 • In Pharma, we reduced field force reporting time by 85% using a GenAI assistant over sales ops and SFA data.

 • In Retail, we enabled anomaly detection across 10,000+ SKUs—driving a 6% margin recovery within weeks.

 • In Banking, we simplified access to risk and compliance data, cutting report turnaround times and reducing dashboard clutter by 70%.

But this transformation isn’t just for technical teams.

I believe the next generation of AI leadership will come from non-technical professionals who learn how to bridge strategy, data, and intelligence. That’s why I actively mentor business leaders, marketers, and domain experts to become AI Strategy Consultants—equipping them to lead in the AI-first era.

I’m deeply grateful for everyone who has supported this mission.

Let’s create a future where AI doesn’t replace people—but amplifies human intelligence, empathy, and leadership.

Let’s connect if you’re building an AI-first enterprise, or DM me if you’re exploring how to bring GenAI into your business or career.

In 2016, College Nannies, Sitters & Tutors was acquired by Bright Horizons Family Solutions (NYSE: BFAM), the largest corporate sponsored childcare operator globally.

Throughout my career, I have driven profitability across VC-backed startups, PE-backed companies, and Fortune 500 firms. I believe in leading from the front-lines, building models, forecasts, and data pipelines that enable growth. 

There is much more to FP&A than spreadsheets and budget reports. Yes, I love diving deep into data and uncovering insights that others miss. But ultimately, I help companies bridge the gap between their ambitious growth plans and the financial systems and processes needed to get things done. 

My defining experience involved launching HomeRoom as a startup co-founder. What began as a 3-person team quickly became a 60-person company that scaled 500% in revenue across 47 markets. I designed the financial infrastructure from scratch (accounting, budgeting, data analysis) that enabled us to raise $6.1M in funds and achieve breakeven within 18 months. 

When Bungalow acquired HomeRoom in 2024, I led the integration, consolidating $250M in assets and guiding the executive team through strategic decisions on pricing, go-to-market strategy, and cost reduction. It was the complete startup-to-exit journey, and I was there for every financial milestone.

In addition to his achievements as a founder, Ravi has also made notable contributions to several renowned platforms in the social networking sphere.

- I am a product manager in high tech with hands on development experience,
- I always try to bring B2C product experience to B2B tools,
- I love KISS (Keep It Simple and Stupid) principle, 
- I am inspired by the combination of art and engineering,

@Ango
- I am currently gathering human minds with the best annotation tool to drive leading-edge AI innovations.
- I believe that paradigm shift from model centric to data centric AI is necessary to achieve better models.
- My ultimate goal is to discover and develop unprecedented BCIs to teach artificial minds human intuition with the highest resolution.

There are great open source and commercial data labeling platforms out there, but each has its own set of drawbacks. Ango Hub fills what we felt were the biggest gaps in the industry. Here are some of its key features:

🌟 Versatility: It’s versatile, supporting any data type you throw at it. It handles image, video, audio, text, PDF, and multi-page images, all with a common interface.
🌟 Scalability and collaboration: Ango Hub comes with features such as intra-labeler consensus, review workflows, centralized instructions, a real-time issue/feedback system, a sample label library for your annotators, and more. 
🌟 AI Assistance: Our experiences and studies showed that too much support from AI Assistance may result in a tendency to over-rely, besides most of the AI Assistance tools are domain specific and costly to use. In Ango Hub we focused on cost effective, domain agnostic, easy to use interactive tools to support labelers with the right amount.
🌟 Plugins: Even though most of the labeling platforms can cover the basic needs of labeling projects, small customizations on the platform can drastically improve the whole labeling process. This is why we created plugins. With plugins you can create and share your own models, formatters and interactors easily.
🌟 Security: We have plenty of options for when a complete lockdown of data is needed, including the possibility of installing Ango Hub directly on your own datacenter, on-premise, so that your data never leaves your server.",34,,Director of Technology,iMerit Technology · Full-time,Co Founder - CTO,Ango AI,DataBoss Security & Analytics A.

MetaBrain Labs,Active,Alexandrea Day,"Sensor-Driven AI Agent Expert | Founder @MetaBrain Labs | Real-Time, Data-Centric Human-AI Interaction",https://www.linkedin.com/in/alexandreaday,"Bellevue, Washington, United States","I’m a serial entrepreneur, inventor, and platform builder with a track record of seeing what’s next—and building it before the market knows it’s needed. Sometimes the market catches up. Sometimes it doesn’t. But today, with the rise of sensor-driven, conversational AI agents making real-time decisions, the market has come straight to my door.

I conceived two-factor authentication before SMS infrastructure could support it. I built and patented video preview technology years before it became standard across major platforms. I developed an interactive video ad builder that drew attention from Google and led to an invitation to HQ. I later launched a national video production platform from scratch, scaling it to $500K ARR in just seven months with a network of over 800 videographers and full in-house post-production serving top-tier agencies across the U.S.

What ties it all together is my focus on building platforms designed to scale—technically, operationally, and commercially.

Today, I lead MetaBrain Labs, where we’ve patented and deployed a breakthrough AI agent platform that transforms real-time sensor data into intelligent, conversational decision-making. Our agents connect to wearable, clinical, and equipment-based sensors—ingesting, validating, and responding to live inputs—while guiding users through context-aware interactions that drive outcomes across healthcare, clinical trials, industrial IoT, elite performance, and beyond.

I authored the foundational patent for this architecture in mid-2021—before conversational AI was mainstream. Now granted as U.S. Patent No. 11,996,179 B2, it protects the core mechanism for enabling real-time, sensor-integrated AI agents. This isn’t conceptual IP. It’s a tested, production-ready platform already in market.

Our go-to-market strategy is clear: we’re offering source code, IP protection, and integration support to platforms that want freedom, not vendor lock-in. Most AI offerings today are black boxes—impossible to extend, customize, or truly own. We’ve built the opposite: a transparent, fully operable system companies can embed, control, and scale across their entire stack.

This is more than invention—it’s strategic enablement. I’ve weathered market shifts, hype cycles, and investment deserts by building tech that endures.

Now, I’m focused on licensing this platform and its patent portfolio to companies ready to lead in the next phase of human-machine interaction. If your roadmap includes AI that’s explainable, extensible, and uniquely yours—we should talk.",47,,"CEO, Founder, Author & Innovator",MetaBrain Labs Inc. · Full-time,Senior Video Producer,VideoCrewUSA · Part-time,Founder & Executive Director,IAffirm · Part-time,Antioch University Seattle,Psychology,,,AI Agents,Wearable Technology,BCI,Artificial Intelligence (AI),Enterprise Software,1,,Featured guest on 'Think Big with Dan & Qasim' discussing mindset restructuring and behavioral transformation,,7.0,positive,,,,Scaled Modus from $0 to $20 million in annual revenue in 3 years; Won 1st place at a startup hackathon leading to Modus founding; Sold Modus to Compass in a high 8-figure deal,L4,"The founder demonstrates a track record of building and scaling technology companies with some notable achievements, particularly in video technology and AI.

Alpha AI,Active,Steven Wolfe Pereira,CEO @ Alpha • Advancing AI Governance for Board Directors,https://www.linkedin.com/in/wolfepereira,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Steven Wolfe Pereira founded Alpha to solve a critical problem: most boards are governing AI transformation without the frameworks, intelligence, or peer networks they need to make sound fiduciary decisions.

Alpha delivers what directors actually use: proprietary governance intelligence, executive-level AI education, and access to the most AI-experienced board members navigating similar challenges. Our clients include public and private company boards facing AI decisions that will define their competitive position and regulatory exposure for the next decade.

Wolfe Pereira brings relevant operating experience: 25+ years driving technology transformation, including $5+ billion in strategic transactions as Chief Marketing Officer at AI-first companies Datalogix (acquired by Oracle, $1.2B) and Neustar (acquired by Golden Gate Capital, $3B). His executive leadership spans Publicis Groupe, TelevisaUnivision, Quantcast, and co-founding the award-winning edtech company Encantos. He began in private equity at Blackstone Group and Salomon Smith Barney and started his technology career in 1999 joining Akamai Technologies in their network infrastructure engineering group. 

Currently serving as an independent board director at the Latino Community Foundation, Save the Children, and Whalar, Steven understands governance challenges from both an experienced operator and the boardroom perspective. His AI governance insights have been featured in major business publications, and LinkedIn named him a Top Voice.

SQOR Technologies Inc.,Active,Laz Fuentes,"CEO of SQOR.ai | Powerful AI-for-BI, and truly no-code. Get advanced analytics in minutes and start making smarter decisions. The promise of AI ROI is as simple as SQOR.ai.",https://www.linkedin.com/in/lazfuentes,"New York, New York, United States","As the Founder and CEO of SQOR.ai, Lazaro Fuentes is tackling one of the most urgent problems in business today: the bloated and unsustainable cost of traditional data and analytics. Companies are under pressure to deliver insights, AI-driven recommendations, and measurable ROI, but most are stuck with overbuilt dashboards, overwhelmed data teams, and underwhelming results. SQOR fixes that. The platform connects directly to a company’s data sources and instantly analyzes more than 500 KPIs, surfacing trends, causation, forecasts, and recommended actions with no setup, no dashboards, and no data teams required. Already in use at over 300 companies, SQOR gives leaders the clarity and speed they need to act decisively and cut waste.

Laz is a three-time founder and turnaround expert with a long track record of building, scaling, and reviving companies across industries. SQOR itself was born from the due diligence process he developed and used to help private equity and venture investors unlock billions in value from underperforming and distressed assets. What began as a proprietary method to diagnose execution gaps is now a fully scalable platform any business can deploy in minutes.

Earlier in his career, Laz served as a U.S. Army Infantry company commander, then became an investment banker at Salomon Brothers and Smith Barney, working on Jamie Dimon’s team. There, he executed over $7BN (seven billion) in M&A and capital markets transactions before taking on senior roles in VC- and PE-backed companies, leading operational transformations that improved profitability and accelerated growth.

SQOR is the culmination of everything he’s learned on the ground, in the boardroom, and inside the most demanding investment environments. His mission is to give every operator and investor the ability to see what matters, fix what’s broken, and make better decisions—without the complexity, cost, or delays of traditional BI.",51,,Founder and CEO,SQOR Technologies Inc. · Full-time,Hip Venture,15 yrs 3 mos,EVP Strategic Partnerships and Corporate Development,Synup · Contract,Columbia University,"Bachelor of Arts (B.A.), Political Philosophy",,,Board of Directors,Corporate Strategy,Early-Stage Startups,Sales Growth,Business Growth Strategies,5,,Speaker at Constellation's Artificial Intelligence Forum 2024,0,7.0,positive,,,,"Entrepreneurship in New York, NY",L4,"Laz Fuentes demonstrates a strong operational background with significant executive experience across multiple domains.

Kita Commerce,Active,Victor Zhu,Executive Director at Kita | Do cool things with cool people,https://sg.linkedin.com/in/zhu-victor,"Singapore, Singapore","I'm still under 30, but not for long!

In my first career as the Founder of Hatch, I focused on making quality learning and employment opportunities accessible and equitable for all, regardless of social or economic background. My team and I prototyped and scaled up Singapore's first placement-focused program into the digital sectors, first for out-of-school and at-risk youths, and subsequently for persons with disabilities. 

I chose to work on the issue of equitable access to opportunities because that was - in the words of my naive 21-year old self - a ""dumb problem"" to exist. Engaged and empowered individuals lead more fulfilling lives, contribute to stronger businesses, and make up a healthier and more productive economy. There is, also, absolutely no reason to reserve quality opportunities for the privileged. 

I am now working on my second career as the Executive Director of Kita, a youth development non-profit using person-centric and participatory practices to return agency to youths and their communities. In many ways, Kita spun out of our experiences journeying with learners at Hatch. What if we saw development beyond the lens of career programs, but through the potential of building and honouring spaces for discovery and growth?

I think I am more measured today, and better see at a systems level why things are the way they are. But I am also more intentional in keeping that same naive and idealistic part of me that believes in doing much more, and much better, in creating the systems for every individual to become the best versions of themselves. 

If that resonates with you too, I would love to chat.

Physicians have a unique responsibility - not just to care for patients but to help shape the future of medicine by translating impactful research into real-world solutions.

As the co-founder and former CEO of StrokeDx, a neuroimaging startup focused on accelerating and expanding access to stroke detection, I raised $7.7M in venture and grant funding, forged strategic partnerships across academia and industry, developed two novel products, and led our team to win the 2023 MedTech Innovator $350k Grand Prize, placing first among 1,200+ global startups.

In 2025, I was recognized on the Forbes 30 Under 30 list in Science for my work bridging medicine, engineering, and health equity.

On the academic side, I’ve contributed to over 100 peer-reviewed publications, podium presentations, and scientific abstracts - earning 600 citations and an h-index of 13. My research encompasses Orthopaedic surgical outcomes, risk modeling, and healthcare economics, as well as basic and translational science focused on biomechanics, muscle degeneration, and pathology of the spine and joints.

At my core, I’m driven by the belief that we need more physicians at the forefront of healthcare innovation. No one understands patients’ needs more intimately. When clinicians are empowered to translate their ideas from the bedside into scalable solutions, real change happens. Patients deserve us not only in the clinic - but also at the whiteboard, in the boardroom, and on the bench.

The real culprit? Garbage data. Lesson learned: a shiny chart on rotten data is just expensive décor.

Salesforce is a beast mighty, yet slow, messy, and unique to every org. ChatGPT can talk about it, but it can't fix your custom chaos.RevOps drowns in dirty data, ticket backlogs, broken flows, permission errors, and week-long report waits. 

I stopped yelling at Salesforce and built Clientell—an AI janitor-pilot that scrubs your data, patches flows, and ships dashboards while you hunt for the coffee mug you just set down. Skip the swearing, hit autopilot 👉 app.clientell.ai 🚀

What Clientell Does (in under 5 minutes):
✅  Builds or updates complex reports & dashboards on demand (no more waiting weeks).
✅  Fixes broken flows, permissions, and validation rules that stall your team.
✅  Cleans & deduplicates data (before it pollutes your forecasts).
✅  Even tackles Apex errors and custom automations without breaking a sweat.

All through a simple chat with an AI that gets your unique setup. No busy-work, no guesswork – just results.

Why Trust It? Clientell isn't theory; it's battle-tested:
➡  380k+ Salesforce tasks completed (and counting)
➡  84% of requests auto-resolved without human intervention
➡ ~$120k average annual savings per org in consultant & admin costs
➡  Secure by design: SOC-2 & GDPR compliant, with zero PII leakage

I specialize in connecting strategy to execution, leading cross-functional teams to deliver scalable, data-driven solutions that achieve measurable results.

➜ What I Do Best
🔹  I craft and execute digital roadmaps that accelerate enterprise delivery, leading complex SaaS, integrations, and analytics programs. I bring extensive experience in business process optimization, project/program management, portfolio leadership, and infrastructure modernization—consistently aligning technology investments with business priorities.

➜ My Expertise
🔹 With an MBA degree and a B.S. in Computer Science, I blend business acumen with technical depth, giving me a 360° view across product, platform, and people. My background spans software engineering, data analytics, IT operations, and agile transformation (SAFe, Scrum).

I studied Economics in Strasbourg but fell in love with statistics and game theory. My intro to data science came when Maksym showed me a Kaggle dataset, leading us to learn R on DataCamp.

After a year at the Toulouse School of Economics, I left to become a Junior Data Scientist—where a simple web scraping task introduced me to Python.

A year later, Maksym and I launched a side project to automate online data collection. In two months, we built the foundation of what became NewsCatcher, following one of Y Combinator’s greatest pieces of advice: ""launch fast"".

“ . . . she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was, physically, touching her, were stood, like the treasures in the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them out, would teach one everything, but they would never be offered openly, never made public. What art was there, known to love or cunning, by which one pressed through into those secret chambers? What device for becoming, like waters poured into one jar, inextricably the same, one with the object one adored? Could the body achieve, or the mind, subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain? or the heart? Could loving, as people called it, make her and Mrs. Ramsay one? for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired, not inscriptions on tablets, nothing that could be written in any language known to men, but intimacy itself, which is knowledge, she had thought, leaning her head on Mrs. Ramsay’s knee.”

Pharmacological solutions exist, but they are not always sufficient. Too often, the procedure is performed in an environment that is hostile to both the child and the clinician.

During my studies, I became interested in the potential of gamification as a way to divert the patient's attention: a child absorbed in their game will be less subject to stress and pain. The development of virtual reality reinforced my belief that a new approach was possible. 

With the support of researchers and technology experts, Paperplane Therapeutics was born in 2019. This virtual reality therapeutic video game offering serves two purposes:

► For the patient: Reduces procedure time, anxiety, and pain perception
► For the clinician: Increases job satisfaction and facilitates the completion of procedures

Technology now offers us the opportunity to practice medicine differently.

Hints,Active,DM Hints,CEO,https://www.linkedin.com/in/dm-hints-b91b54188,United States,"Digital marketing competitive analysis examples
 In order for businesses to remain competitive, they must regularly conduct digital marketing competitive analysis. This involves analyzing the tactics your competitors are using, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. By doing so, you can discern what strategies you should emulate and which ones you should avoid. Additionally, you can find opportunities where your business can excel and differentiate itself from the competition.
Below are a few examples of popular digital marketing competitive analysis.
SEO Analysis
One of the most important aspects of any digital marketing campaign is SEO. By doing a competitive analysis of your competitor's websites, you can get an idea of what keywords they are targeting and how they are optimizing their pages for those terms. You can also see what backlinks they are acquiring and whether or not their websites are being penalized by Google. Conducting a proper SEO analysis will help you determine the best SEO strategy to target in your own campaign.
Backlink Gap Analysis
  
Another important aspect of SEO is backlinking. By conducting a competitive analysis of your competitor's backlinks, you can get an idea of the quality and quantity of links they have. You can also find opportunities to acquire similar links for your website. SEM Rush provides an incredible Backlink gap tool that allows you to compare the backlink profiles of up to five competitors at once.
Keyword Gap Analysis
Another way to conduct a competitive analysis is by looking at your competitor's keywords. By doing this, you can see which terms they are targeting and how they are ranking for them. You can also get ideas for new keywords to target in your own campaigns. A proper keyword analysis is crucial for any effective SEO strategy.
Ad Analysis
Another important aspect of any digital marketing campaign is paid to advertise. By looking at your competitor's ads, you can see what terms they are targeting and the creativity that they are using. This can give you ideas for new ad campaigns to launch, as well as new keywords to target. You can also get an idea of what is working for your competitor and try to replicate those results. An effective ad analysis can help you quickly improve your ad campaigns.
Social Media Analysis
Another important part of any digital marketing campaign is social media. Conducting an analysis of your competitor's social media profiles allows you to see the type of content they are sharing and the voice that they are using.",39,,Chief Executive Officer,DM Hints · Full-time,Team Lead Manager,The coast Motel,,,Garden City University,Master of Computer Applications - MCA,,,CEOs,Advertising,Brand Development,,,0,,,0,0.0,neutral,,,,,L1,"Based on the available information, this appears to be a nascent founder with minimal verifiable entrepreneurial experience.

At Gaize, we’ve tackled one of the most critical challenges in safety-sensitive environments and roadways: detecting current drug impairment accurately, objectively, and fairly.

Traditional chemical drug tests can only tell if someone has used a substance in the past—not whether they’re impaired right now. This outdated approach unfairly penalizes responsible users of substances like THC while failing to protect roadways and workplaces from real-time safety risks. Worse, with thousands of substances that can cause impairment, a chemical test alone is insufficient.

Gaize changes the game. In just six minutes, our cutting-edge, non-invasive ocular technology detects physiological impairment from virtually any substance—offering unparalleled accuracy in real-world conditions. Portable, scalable, and scientifically validated, our solution empowers businesses, law enforcement, and safety leaders to make informed, defensible decisions based on actual impairment, not history of use.

V2M,Active,Petr Bakulov,"CEO, founder of V2M, PhD",https://www.linkedin.com/in/petrbakulov,"Boca Raton, Florida, United States","I am a Ph.D. with 15 years of experience in the automotive business, 10 years of academic work, and a former professor at Moscow Automobile and Road Construction State Technical University (MADI).
 
I have loved cars and everything about them since I was a kid. I was growing up in Russia in the 90’s, it was the time when we finally started to see foreign cars on our roads. Even though my family had no car, I was doing my best to get to learn them, and at some point, I knew every model and could tell them apart even from the far. I still practice this magic tough, I literally know every car you see on the road. I always knew my life would be associated with cars, but little I knew I would be able to invent V2M technology, then build a team, and together we would make cars hearing!

The idea of making cars hearing was born back in 2012 when I decided to partially replace the work of a consultant advisor at the dealership with an automated expert diagnostic system. I wanted to implement this in my dealership business, but when I realized the potential of this idea, I made it a thesis of my Ph.D. work and began to form a science base for the product. 

It took me nine years to walk a path from an idea to an utterly scientific case and a patent right in the United States. In 9 years of V2M history, almost a dozen articles were published, including an article in Scopus. This is the highest level of scholarly publication, and it marks V2M recognition at the international scientific level.  	

V2M makes cars hear, so cars will be able to diagnose malfunctions the moment they occur. We have already bought the first test vehicle and installed the prototype. 
In the end, it is 98% the accuracy of recognition malfunctions, and it takes less than 2 seconds to recognize a malfunction. 

I haven't been so excited about new technology on the car market, probably since Tesla was born, and now I look forward to seeing what the future holds for V2M.",37,,Chief Executive Officer,V2M Inc · Full-time,Professor,Moscow State Automobile and Road Technical Institute (State Technical University) (MADI) · Part-time,Co-Founder,Larson Car · Part-time,Moscow State Automobile and Road Technical Institute (State Technical University) (MADI),"Ph.D, Automotive Engineering Technology/Technician",,,Higher Education Administration,Special Education,Education,Teaching,Tutoring,3,,Author of original report on AI implementation in automotive industry (May 2024),0,6.0,positive,,,,PhD in Automotive Engineering Technology; Co-founded Larson Car; Founder and CEO of V2M Inc.; Published work on vehicle acoustic based diagnostic systems,L3,"The founder demonstrates strong technical and academic credentials with 15 years of automotive industry experience and a PhD in Automotive Engineering.

His expertise spans digital ad optimization, eCommerce conversion and revenue optimization, and ML-based audience targeting.

🚀 Currently, Tobi serves as Chief Innovation Officer at Fenix Commerce, where he leads product strategy focused on ""amazonizing"" the delivery and checkout experience for some of the largest e-commerce stores with Machine Learning, tying in downstream supply chain systems with measurable lift in conversion rates and revenues.

🧠 Under his leadership, Fenix launched the Fenix Incrementality Engine—the first always-on incrementality testing platform powered by intermittent, efficient experimentation and sophisticated machine learning.

💡 Before Fenix, Tobi founded and led Ocurate, which tackled the core problem of unpredictable and low ROAS (returns on advertising spend) for consumer brands. Ocurate’s proprietary ML predicted per-customer revenue with high precision and integrated directly with ad platforms for real-time bid optimization based on long-term customer value. Over 3 years, Tobi raised $5.5M in VC funding, scaled the product to >$500K ARR, and led the company to a successful acquisition by Fenix Commerce in October 2025.

📊 Tobi’s entrepreneurial journey began as co-founder and CEO of PredictWise, where he built advanced psychographic and behavioral targeting models using a fusion of proprietary polling, mobile data, and large-scale public datasets. Under his leadership, PredictWise crossed $2M in revenue and established itself as a pioneer in audience intelligence and political targeting.

Martin, an inventor from a young age, founded his first startup during his undergraduate studies in Iran, where he created and sold six different inventions. His own international student journey began in 2010 where he got his Masters in Mechatronics Engineering from the University of Waterloo. Realizing the opportunity international students had at their fingertips, he helped his brothers, Meti and Massi, navigate the same complex process of applying to study abroad, and the three of them founded ApplyBoard in 2015. 

Martin served as CEO of ApplyBoard from 2015 to 2022. Under his leadership ApplyBoard grew to a team of 1500+ assisting more than 1M students with their study abroad journey from more than 130 countries. During this time ApplyBoard partnered with over 1,600+ schools across Canada, US, UK, Australia and Ireland. ApplyBoard was named the fastest growing tech company in Canada and became globally recognized with a valuation of over $3B, and attracting $500 million in investments. 

At ApplyBoard, Martin noticed a limitation. There were many deserving students who he wished to help who did not have the financial means to do so. Driven by his commitment and passion for the mission of “educating the world”, he started Passage in 2023. Passage’s goal is to provide financial access for deserving individuals that - through no fault of their own - grew up without the means to fulfill their potential.

Over 750 million of people suffer from hair & scalp problems.

To solve them, they either:

Self-medicate (using google) - which leads to misdiagnosis, incorrect dosages, side effects, and more.

Or try to find a clinic and a doctor which is difficult, expensive, and slow.

That’s why I created iHairium - an innovative AI-powered haircare ecosystem for hair & scalp diagnosis and treatment.

We focus on 3 things:

1️⃣ Help patients with diagnosis and treatment recommendations using our mobile & web app.

I'm Kuber Mehta, an 18-year-old AI developer from New Delhi, who builds (and breaks) stuff to blend creativity with technology to build impactful AI-driven solutions. 
My expertise spans Full Stack Development, Generative AI, Machine Learning, LLM Post Training, Resource-Bound Programming, and Data Science, with a keen interest in AI's role in media and creative applications.

Currently, I’m a Perplexity AI Business Fellow, building agentic AI pipelines and workflows at PolyThink to reduce AI hallucinations. I also lead TREAT, an open-core AI organization focused on flagging triggering content in media using post-trained LLMs, supporting 15+ AI models with 30+ contributors. 

Over the past 9 months, I’ve created and contributed to 30+ AI projects across research, tooling, and creative use cases, some of which have gone viral on Hacker News and here on LinkedIn.

I’m pursuing a dual academic path: a BSc in Computer Science at BITS Pilani and a BTech in AI & Data Science at Indraprastha University. 

With over 10 years of 3D modeling experience, I’ve designed 1000+ renders for gaming and virtual environments, combining technical precision with creative aesthetics.

Some of my favorite projects include:

👉 TREAT: Leading an AI-powered platform to scan movie and TV scripts for triggering content, now supporting 15+ AI models with a growing community of contributors.

👉 The Backdooms: A self-contained game fitting inside a QR code, inspired by DOOM 1993 and The Backrooms. Built with a custom compression algorithm, it topped Hacker News’ Show HN for two days and was featured by Yahoo News, PC Gamer, and more.

👉 Books Reimagined: An AI tool rewriting books from different character perspectives, ranking Top 10 in Google’s Kaggle Gemini 1.5 Long Context Competition.

👉 MiniLMs: Ongoing research into AI model architectures, including SYNEVA, a <3kb Markov Chain-inspired chatbot reminiscent of ELIZA, designed to be engaging and fun.

I’m currently studying Transformers.js, WebGPU and how platforms like YouTube and TikTok leverage AI to refine recommendation algorithms and shape user engagement. 
At my core, I’m an experimenter and builder, always pushing the boundaries of technology.

How can I help?",https://www.linkedin.com/in/shekharguptaprofile,"Overland Park, Kansas, United States","I describe myself with three words: Consistent, Persistent, and Resilient (CPR). These traits have been instrumental in my accomplished career spanning over 20 years as a result-oriented and decisive leader in engineering, innovation, technology development, delivery, systems integration, and strategic market positioning of products and networks. My experience encompasses working with startups, small companies, and Fortune 200 organizations, giving me a well-rounded perspective.

With an in-depth understanding of methodologies like Kaizen, Scrum, and SDLC, I have excelled in taking smaller startups and transforming them into successful, differentiated companies. My ability to develop new revenue-generating products and services has been a key driver of growth. Notably, I led teams to develop and launch licensing and permits products, making NIC the number one provider in the hunting and fishing outdoor licensing market. At Motorola, I spearheaded the development and launch of products and services, establishing the company as a leader in its segment, particularly in multiscreen content for airlines.

My leadership extends to managing cross-functional teams, including software developers, architects, UX managers, requirement managers, and technical writers. I place a strong emphasis on user experience, ensuring all products have a consistent look and feel, providing a seamless experience across multiple offerings. This attention to detail and commitment to quality is a hallmark of my approach.

Furthermore, I embrace the concept of ""Jugaad innovation,"" a term coined by Harvard Business Review, which involves frugal and rapid prototyping while maximizing available resources. This mindset has enabled me to drive innovation efficiently and effectively, leveraging resources to their fullest potential.

I am also an avid hunter and fisherman. I love outdoors.

With a background that blends technology expertise with a deep understanding legal industry, I am driven by the vision of making legal services more accessible and user-friendly.

Vikk AI: Transforming Legal Assistance

Vikk AI, is not just a company; it's a catalyst for change in the legal sector. Our core product, Vikk, an AI-powered legal assistant, is designed to provide immediate, accurate, and accessible legal assistance to everyone, regardless of their legal knowledge or financial resources. We're breaking down the traditional barriers that have made legal advice seem out of reach for so many.

Innovating at the Intersection of Law and Technology:

At Vikk AI, we're constantly pushing the boundaries of what's possible at the intersection of law and technology. We use advanced generative AI to interpret and simplify complex legal jargon, making it understandable for our users. Our AI system is trained on a vast repository of legal knowledge, ensuring that it can provide comprehensive assistance across a wide spectrum of legal specialties.

Empowering Users and Legal Professionals:

One of our key objectives at Vikk AI is to empower not just our users but also legal professionals. While our platform provides 24/7 legal assistance to users, it also helps lawyers streamline their workflow. With features like our upcoming Lawyer Feed, set to launch in 2024, lawyers will be able to connect users who have posted their cases after discussing with Vikk AI.

It is hard to tell your own story. My favorite clients are often people who tell me that they can recognize the strengths and values in other people but have a hard time articulating their own. 
Or at least packaging that narrative on a modern resume. 

I am not a touchy-feely 'let's take assessments' kind of coach. I value assessments & think they can be important for job seekers who need help figuring out their strengths & motivators. However, I work best with people who know where they want to go and just need help getting there. 

I work with all career levels - from C-suite to career sprinters, including Chief Marketing Officer, Chief Technology Officers, Customer Experience Officers, Chief Operations Officers, Chief Medical Officer & more. Our clients have landed roles at top Fortune 100 and 500 companies, including AT&T, Alphabet, Home Depot, JPMorgan Chase, Optum & Nike.

I believe in positively changing the trajectory of people's lives through goal setting, purposeful action & strategic networking. 

I help my clients think bigger AND better articulate their unique value proposition.

I offer 5 solutions:

◆  Behavioral-based mock interviews. I offer highly personalized mock interviews virtually through Zoom. I can help you master questions like, ""tell me about yourself"" or ""tell me about the toughest decision you've had to make in the past six months."" I understand the interview process and will ensure you are prepared.

◆  Executive-style resumes, board resumes/bios, and other career marketing collateral. No forms. My resumes are attractive, ATS-friendly, and full of quantifiable data. My goal is to hear you say, ""wow! I look great on paper!""

◆ Strategic Job Search Coaching. Stop turning your wheels applying for job after job online. My clients land meetings with decision-makers at top employers and get jobs they really want. 

◆ LinkedIn Training. I am a super-user & have been training business leaders how to use the platform since 2007. 

◆  Medical CVs for residents, fellows, physicians, dentists & podiatrists. 

🙌  My company, Briefcase Coach 💼, has been named the top resume writing agency for experienced executives by Balance Careers.

I was named to the list of 2021 most influential people in the HR Space and 2019 LinkedIn Top Voice for the career space.

Bio:
I'm a seasoned content marketer whose focus over the last 15 years has been on staying at the forefront of press earning content creation and promotion online. While the methods have changed as new channels have emerged, the base principles remain the same. Create something that provides value, activates emotions, and demonstrates to the brand's unique selling proposition in an organic way, and it is possible to see the unmatched power of content-based inbound marketing. 



I believe that we've entered a new era in how brands and customers interact, an era characterized by a more equitable business-consumer relationship. Customers have more choice and more voice than ever before, and as a result, companies need to find new ways to provide value through their marketing. It is no longer enough to simply get the word out. Customer-brand relationships are now much more reciprocal and transparent. Valuable content is the new currency of this evolved relationship. 

Over the last 12 years at Fractl, my partners and I have put our heart and souls into creating what we believe to be the best team and processes out there for creating and promoting content that yields consistent and high levels of success. By developing a deep understanding of a brand's goals, and connecting those goals with the needs of their audiences, we've been able to drive unprecedented ROIs for clients in some of the most competitive niches online. 

If you think Fractl could help your business meet its goals through content, I'm always happy to provide advice, or give my opinion. Please don't hesitate to reach out for any reason at all.

Relay,Active,Jacob Bank,Founder/CEO at Relay.app | I teach people how to build AI agents,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobbank,San Francisco Bay Area,"I help businesses of all shapes and sizes use AI to get more done.

I'm currently the founder/CEO of Relay.app, where we're building an easy-to-use platform that enables everyone to create AI agents that work for them.

I also post actionable tips about the latest AI tools. I try to keep my recommendations concise, practical, and honest about what AI can and can't do today.

You'll see a few different types of posts from me:
1. Demonstrations of specific AI agents that you may find useful
2. Stories about my own adventures (and misadventures) with using AI tools
3. Updates on what we're doing at Relay.app

Here's what led me here:
- I started my career as a PhD student in the Multi-agent systems group in the AI Lab at Stanford, where I worked with Yoav Shoham and Dan Ariely on AI applied to product tools.
- I dropped out of my PhD to become the founder/CEO of Timeful, an AI-powered calendar that helped users find time for their tasks, habits, goals and projects.
- After Timeful was acquired by Google in 2015, I became a PM Director at Google, responsible for Gmail, Google Calendar, the Workspace Developer Platform, and more.
- I left Google in 2021 to start Relay.app.

If you're looking for ways to get started with AI, follow me here on LinkedIn or check out the Relay.app YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCIENacxDzvxb7mWIXZRZtAQ.

Resound was born from a blind spot I kept seeing: audio is powerful, but rarely prioritized by most brands and agencies. I believe that when done right, audio isn’t just an add-on. It’s a differentiator. Resound exists to change how brands think about sound - from afterthought to advantage.

Resound was built to help brands show up intentionally in the audio space. We bring together strategy, creative and media experience under one roof, coupled with deep industry relationships to deliver full-service, end-to-end audio campaigns that resonate.

I'm glad you're here, and can't wait to get to know you!

Let's see if I can pinpoint how you got here:

✔ You're navigating the exciting but intricate world of chamber memberships and associations, seeking tangible growth, well-defined purpose and meaningful connections.
✔ You're using AI and innovative strategies to enrich your organization's impact (or desperately want to!), and are looking for context, camaraderie and conversation.
✔ You're looking to transform your storytelling into a powerful tool that resonates deeply with your audience.

What I do is bring all of those things together.  

With nearly two decades of experience with chambers of commerce and business associations, I'm consistently refining the art of fostering growth through strategic networking, leveraging AI for efficiency, and storytelling that captivates. At Momentum, we don't chase opportunities; we create them.

From my early days at the regional chamber in Western New York to launching Momentum a decade ago, to now guiding the Niagara USA Chamber of Commerce as chair, my mission has been clear: unlock potential, navigate growth, and tell great stories. As an author of 10 books and a seasoned political consultant, I've worked hard to harness the power of narrative and strategy to chart new paths.

Whether you're looking to enhance your chamber's influence, grow your company, discover the untapped potential of AI, or craft stories that move mountains, let's connect. Together, we'll explore the possibilities that lie ahead.

At Armada, our goal extends beyond mere technological advancements; we are committed to making cutting-edge computing and AI solutions universally accessible, ensuring that every corner of the globe is interconnected.  
 
My entrepreneurial journey is anchored in a deep commitment to building and empowering exceptional teams, nurturing their growth, and driving operational excellence in the ever-changing landscape of disruptive technology. This journey has been marked by significant milestones and learning experiences, shaping my approach to business and leadership. 
 
Before my current role at Armada, I was at the helm of DataRobot as CEO. During my tenure, the company was featured on CNBC's Disruptor 50 and Forbes' Cloud 100 lists for three consecutive years.

In my tenure as the COO of AppDynamics, I led the company's ascent to become the foremost application performance management (APM) vendor.

I am focused on using the power of blockchain and smart contracts to disrupt business models and create powerful new ways of exchanging assets. While it is early days for blockchain, I believe strongly that now is the time for businesses to understand the implications of blockchain for their industry, including: monetising illiquid assets, tokenising assets, disintermediation, decentralisation and devolved trust.

I apply games technology to non-gaming sectors - spanning culture, education, health, architecture, and R&D - and have delivered work for clients including David Hockney, Marvel, the BBC, Channel 4, Sky, Universal, HSBC, and The Guide Dogs Association.

I get results.

A few highlights:

- Worked with Narwhal Studios (Virtual Art Department behind The Mandalorian) on Marvel’s Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, building multiuser VR tools to help filmmakers plan sets.

- Developed iPad apps for David Hockney, enabling digital paintings, videos, and immersive works. His assistants can export high-res brushstrokes via Apple’s Metal API and preview work using AR. The video output is also used in immersive installations.

- Created a sign language-based learning game using machine learning and Kinect/depth sensors - 2015 Japan Prize runner-up, BAFTA-nominated, and TIGA/BETT finalist.

- Designed accessible fitness games for Blind Children UK, winning ‘Partner of the Year’ with Guide Dogs Association. TIGA finalist for ‘Best Game Design’.

- Jurassic World VR Expedition – award-winning location-based experience.

Dedicated to making a difference, because through creatively addressing solutions to pain seen and experienced, I can. 

Through FairSplit we have created tools to ease the emotional and practical challenges of listing and dividing estates in situations of death, divorce and downsizing. Too often a will reads: ""And divide the rest equally among the children"", or a peaceful divorce gets tanked over face to face divisions. This creates all kinds of both practical challenges and emotionally charged negative possibilities. FairSplit helps divide fairly with its focus on providing transparency and inclusion for all parties, regardless of location or availability. We now offer co-branded capabilities for strategic partners, law firms, family offices, appraisers, etc.

We learned after introducing FairSplit, that there was a need to rapidly list the assets of a home and share with family. We now provide this tool to share photos, categorize and list all assets for FREE.  No more attachments to emails, photo sharing sites and spreadsheets back and forth.  Everyone can just login to their family account.  This free model is a great way for all families to plan and discuss what is to be divided.

It's tradition here to write about how great I am.
I have a better idea.
My team and I are building an AI startup based on an algorithm for diagnosing behavioral patterns.
We look at a person's values and model their behavior in different situations.

So, I will write here about the goal I want to achieve.

When I was a manager, my main problem was delegation and assessment of employees.
The specifics of my department were that all my colleagues worked remotely, some of them I had never seen in person.
At the same time, the responsibility of each employee for their territory and activities was quite high.
In fact, they managed sales in their territory by themselves.

This led to three questions:

- how do I understand that this particular employee will be able to work in this environment?
- how do I manage the team as a whole?
- How do I recognize that problems are coming up in the team, and what kind of problems might they be?

The system that we now use at Skillsy to evaluate and develop employees was not yet in place.

However, it was these questions that drove the development of the algorithm in its current form.

2023 - We created a truly personalized employee assessment system with predictive analytics of behavior in different situations.

Knowing what really matters to your colleagues, what guides their decisions, and what to expect in a crisis is invaluable.

We have gone further.

We don't just tell how things are going in the team.
We build a personalized track and train an individual business AI coach for each employee.

This way, managers know what's going on in the team.
Employees get their own Jarvis, available 24/7.
Have you seen the movie “Her” with Joaquin Phoenix?
That's exactly the kind of product we're making.
We analyze a person's value profile quite deeply and create a predictive model of the person.
Using this data, we train an AI model and the output is an ideal companion who understands you better than anyone else.

We are actively considering teams of 30+ employees for a free pilot project.
If you're interested, chat with me.

I'm very excited. I think we've found a way to tell AI who people really are and what they want.

20 years of experience living on all levels of the web from dark to implementing the thoughts of the capitalist

the blockchain and the possibilities it holds. Despite all the universe & world information in the webspace, there is
nothing that a human cannot do, but not alone, so after increasing the level of my knowledge, I decided to expand
my thoughts, I created all its infrastructure, and now I need to cooperate and experienced people.
