Twitter: @fuelfive",https://www.linkedin.com/in/dscottphoenix,"Berkeley, California, United States","Partner at Fifty Years, investing in deep tech founders at the earliest stages. More about me: https://dscottphoenix.com

Previously, I was cofounder and CEO of Vicarious, an AGI and robotics startup backed by ~$250M from Dustin Moskovitz, Mark Zuckerberg, Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, Founders Fund, Khosla Ventures, DCVC, 8VC, and many others. At Vicarious, I worked with my cofounder Dileep George and our talented team to build one of the first successful AI + robotics companies, as well as publish peer-reviewed research in Science, NeurIPS, ICML, and more. 

Vicarious was acquired by Alphabet in 2022. After the acquisition, I spent a year as the Chief Product & Revenue Officer of Intrinsic, Alphabet’s “other bet” focused on robotics and AI.

Before Vicarious, I was an entrepreneur in residence at Founders Fund, started a company in the Y Combinator 2008 batch, and built an open source game. I also invest in hard tech startups like Sila Nano, Psi Quantum, Verge Genomics, and Science, and advise venture funds like Felicis Ventures, Base10, and 8VC.",41,,Partner,Fifty Years · Full-time,Chief Product & Revenue Officer,Intrinsic · Full-time,Cofounder and CEO,Vicarious AI · Full-time,Y Combinator,,University of Pennsylvania,"BAS, Individualized Computer Science, Business, and Design",Entrepreneurship,Ruby,Python,Start-ups,Venture Capital,3,World Economic Forum Technology Pioneer (2015),KV Summit talk on AI & AGI trends,0,7.0,positive,,,,"Co-founded Vicarious, an AI research company pioneering human-level AI algorithms; Vicarious was acquired by Intrinsic, an Alphabet company, in 2022; Advocate for safe AI development and signatory of the Future of Life Institute's Open Letter on AI; Predicted by 2031 computing systems would surpass human brain neocortical neuron operations; Featured in AI documentaries including 'Do You Trust This Computer?' and 'MACHINE'",Unknown,high,L6,"D.

While the exact exit value isn't public, the caliber of acquirer (Alphabet) and subsequent executive role suggests substantial value. His current role investing in hard tech and advising major funds further validates his industry expertise. The combination of technical innovation, significant funding raised, successful exit, and thought leadership in AI/robotics strongly supports L6 classification.

Podcast: Stuff that matters now",https://uk.linkedin.com/in/nikostzagarakis,New Zealand,"I first became a company director 25 years ago. Since then, I have had experience on a number of boards, both private and public, and have become fascinated in the evolutionary journey of professionals.
What I’ve observed is that some develop, yet many, after a burst of success, stagnate then diminish with time.
It’s why I’ve become fascinated with the challenge of - how do we keep our people evolving, in a world that continues to change?
As a director, we would send senior staff off to courses yet no meaningful change would occur – very frustrating and a waste of investment.
So…… I drew on my farming background and remodeled the farm discussion group, which is a key catalyst to technical transfer in New Zealand agriculture. These farm discussion groups work because farmers will openly share knowledge (due to lack of competition) and, they stay together for years, sometimes for decades.
The iteration eventually became Collective Intelligence, where professionals from over 70 industries and professional backgrounds, come together in teams of nine, to evolve themselves and others.
It works.
The bottom-line? Collective Intelligence members become more effective in their professional and personal lives. 
Effective people build effective companies: Quote from Dave Blackwell – CEO of Spidertracks, and Collective Intelligence member for seven years.
I believe people are capable of great things. They just need some help from time to time.

The strain on supply chains and manufacturing systems require immediate and disruptive solutions. PLCs are rigid by design and today's ""industrial"" products are 4x the cost with .25x the capability vs. standard enterprise tools. Most organizations don't have legions of control engineers to roll out needed systems or take on the tech debt. Mytra provides a platform to simply and efficiently solve the most common task in industry - moving and storing material throughout the facility. These non value add tasks employ between 25-75% of the labor for any industrial operation. Mytra develops a novel racking structure providing a 3D grid traversable along all 3 axes, robots to move material within the system, and the software to easily design, operate, and continuously optimize without the need for automation engineers.

Previous to Mytra I created and led Tesla's Mobile Robotics team. We design, develop, build, and deploy robots across Tesla's manufacturing portfolio. The team includes mechanical, electrical, software, controls, perception, manufacturing, and operations experts. We create wheeled mobile robots that serve our factories, and also develop the humanoid Tesla Bot (Optimus).

CaptureProof,Meghan Conroy,Founder,https://fr.linkedin.com/in/meghan-conroy-281a97,"Paris, Île-de-France, France","Meghan Conroy, the visionary founder of CaptureProof, has redefined the landscape of medical documentation and analysis through her cutting-edge approach to using visual health technology. She identified a crucial gap in healthcare—the need for more accurate, efficient, and patient-friendly ways to capture and analyze medical data—and has since pioneered the use of visual data to transform patient care and outcomes, particularly in neurology.

Conroy’s early scientific work in utilizing home videos for neurology assessments earned her an Oral Poster Designation at the American Academy of Neurology in 2013, highlighting the untapped potential of visual data in improving diagnostic accuracy. Since then, her influence has only expanded. Meghan has continued to break new ground with the development of CaptureProof, an eClinical Outcomes Assessment (eCOA) tool that allows for asynchronous visual healthcare communication. CaptureProof integrates AI, computer vision, and machine learning to capture near real-time photo and video data for everything from PROs to advanced fall risk assessments. This technology has revolutionized the field of neurology by creating “visual endpoints” in medicine—dynamic data points that offer clinicians new dimensions in tracking patient progress and optimizing treatment plans.

Under Conroy's leadership, CaptureProof has evolved into a leading platform, empowering healthcare providers with AI-driven insights into patient mobility, motor functions, and chronic disease management. Its adoption across multiple specialties and its ability to integrate with various clinical workflows make CaptureProof a critical tool in modern healthcare.

Recent milestones include the platform's application in large-scale clinical trials and real-world evidence generation for neurology and geriatric care. CaptureProof has partnered with global healthcare leaders to tackle some of the most pressing challenges in healthcare, from fall prevention to remote patient monitoring.

In addition to her work with CaptureProof, Conroy is also the founder of brilliantHush, a Clinical Trial Photography Management company, and Unicorn Cashmere, a leading e-tailer of luxury cashmere clothing.

Calico,Kathleen C.,Founder & CEO @ Calico | Powering sustainable production for 100+ of your favourite brands.,https://ca.linkedin.com/in/kathleenchan,"Toronto, Ontario, Canada","I have spent the last decade building and scaling two direct-to-consumer brands from 0 to millions in revenue and thousands of SKUs.

Which was when I realized:
→ The lifeblood of my business hinged on my supply chain. 

And yet, the sourcing systems for $10M to $100M brands were broken. Brands are  faced with countless challenges when trying to responsibly source, like:

⛔️ High costs and time investment to scale up their sourcing efforts
⛔️ Loads of inaccuracies with products in final deliveries 
⛔️ Sacrificing margins due to limited production options
⛔️ Wasting months trying to find high-quality factories
⛔️ Frequent delays in production timelines

Given my background, I quickly jumped to solve the gap by launching Calico in 2021. 

Calico’s vetted network of global factories, state of the art production platform and expert production managers help scaling fashion brands operate like industry giants.

We help fast-growing brands take their idea from concept to doorstep in minutes (over months).
Calico is the solution I wish I had 10 years ago.

A few things you'll love:

1) We've helped our clients save $10M in production related costs in the past 3 years with better pricing, terms and priority in lead times

2) Every factory is personally vetted by us to ensure that they don't just meet our strict ethical and environmental standards - they exceed them.

3) Nothing is worse than receiving a delivery riddled with errors. So we make sure your products come to life exactly as you imagined with on the ground support in our factory regions.

4) You get to skip all the expensive production mistakes with our experienced team on your side.

5) Our platform keeps everything transparent and visible in one single place so you get to launch your next best seller without any travel expenses, offshore agents and surprise fees.

Sounds like a good deal?
It is.

Calico is backed up by brilliant investors like Serena Ventures, Menlo Ventures, Maple VC, Inovia Capital, Hyphen Capital and a host of industry angels.

This journey built on my prior experience founding Intuitive Automata and my groundbreaking Ph.D. work at the MIT Media Lab.

Through these roles, I've honed my ability to navigate complex healthcare landscapes and bring together diverse teams to deliver transformative solutions. I'm adept at making advanced technologies accessible to a wide audience, a skill I've leveraged not only in product development but also as a sought-after public speaker and thought leader.

Today, I continue to advise and consult with innovative healthcare technology companies through my role at Sigla Sciences and board positions with Ellipsis Health, Ambit, Silicon Valley Robotics, and others. I'm excited to bring my expertise to new challenges, always with an eye toward creating solutions that are both cutting-edge and human-centered.

Keynote Speaker, Consultant, Writer, Podcast Personality.  Former USA Most Wanted Cybercriminal, Identity Thief, Hacker, and Original Internet Godfather  

I am one of the top experts in the world on cybercrime, identity theft, fraud, and cybersecurity.  My knowledge is unique.  My education does not come from a book, school, investigator, or commentator who has no practical experience on the subject of which they speak.  I have hands on training.  My knowledge is from the criminal side of things.  I have an understanding of cybercrime that the majority of people on the planet will never possess.

I built the first organized cybercrime community, Shadowcrew, while also establishing several forms of financial cybercrime.  Shadowcrew was the precursor to today's Darknet Markets and laid the foundation for the way modern cybercrime channels still operate today.  I was placed on the United States Most Wanted List, convicted of 39  felonies, and sentenced to 7 1/2 years in federal prison.

I am fortunate to be one of the few who have been able to step away from my life of crime--with the help of many.  Today, I use the vast amount of knowledge I have concerning cybersecurity, cybercrime, identity theft, and fraud to help individuals and companies protect themselves from the type of person I used to be.

I speak and consult with some of the most well known entities across the globe.  Clients include The FBI, Microsoft, Lexis-Nexis, ThreatMetrix, VISA, Identity Guard, AARP, Emailage, MWAA, Elavon, TED, ISMG, Neustar, BBWest Bank, and numerous others.

Area 1 Security,Kurtis Minder,Building Safer Digital Ecosystems | Purpose-Driven Advisor & Speaker | Successful Entrepreneur | Author of Cyber Recon,https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtisminder,United States,"My obsession with technology was driven by my parents. My father worked at a flour mill. When I visited his work as a youngster, it shook me. It was hot and loud, with a haze of flour dust in the air. When I visited my mom’s workplace, however, it was clean and quiet, and the coffee machine was within reach. I didn’t understand what my mom did working for the State of Illinois (it was accounting,) but they all had machines on their desks. So, I dug into the technology behind those machines.

Back then, I wasn’t thinking about ransomware, international negotiations, or public policy. I was focused on solving problems—big and small—because I loved the challenge of making something work where others saw impossibility.

Fast forward a few decades and that same love of problem-solving has defined my career. As the founder and CEO of GroupSense, I’ve spent years helping organizations navigate the complex and often dangerous world of cybersecurity. Whether it’s negotiating directly with ransomware threat actors, advising governments on critical infrastructure security, or building tools from scratch, I’ve always approached challenges with a mix of technical depth, empathy, and sheer determination.

My journey has never been conventional. I didn’t enter this field with a pedigree or a perfectly charted plan. Instead, I forged my own path—breaking things, learning quickly, and building solutions that matter. 
Along the way, I’ve been privileged to work with talented teams, influence national security initiatives, and tackle cyber threats that make the headlines.

Now, as I expand my focus to strategic advisory roles, public speaking, and authorship, my mission remains the same: to empower others to navigate the digital world safely and with confidence. I believe the best solutions aren’t just technical—they’re human. And I’m here to bridge that gap.

When I’m not diving deep into cybersecurity challenges, you’ll find me on a motorcycle crossing the country, exploring the outdoors, or tinkering with projects that demand just the right mix of precision and discipline. These moments remind me that the best work comes when we approach life with curiosity, grit, and a sense of purpose.
