- Scale a business to €10M+ in annual revenue
- Build a personal brand with 2 million+ followers
-  Create an iconic network by interviewing legends like Richard Branson, Gary Vaynerchuk, Marc Simoncini, and Tony Parker.

I've experienced firsthand the pain many entrepreneurs and executives face:
You slowly suffocate copying business tactics—important, yes, but not the essence of building an empire. You find yourself running everywhere, gasping for air, yet nothing truly clicks. Frustrating!

After obsessively studying Jobs, Knight (Nike), Chesky (Airbnb), and historical greats like Napoleon, I've uncovered patterns:

🔥 VISION & OBSESSION: They’re driven by a visceral obsession, the kind that attracts top talent and closes impossible deals.
🔥 MYTHOLOGY: They craft a legendary narrative around themselves and their businesses—not generic marketing.
🔥 POWER SKILLS: They're exceptionally strong in the crucial trio—critical thinking, antifragility, and impactful communication.

With Paradox, my mission is clear:
Empower top performers (entrepreneurs and their teams) to scale their businesses and maximize performance while staying deeply aligned and energized.

We build systems to scale—absolutely!
But always anchored in this powerful model: OBSESSION • MYTHOLOGY • POWER SKILLS.

A few vanity metrics:

- 200M+ cumulative views
- YouTube Channels: Paradox Business: 100K+ subscribers • Psychology & Performance: 800K subscribers
- 60,000+ clients served through Paradox

Grata,Active,Rey Ortega,"Founder and Chief Innovation Strategist, Grata LLC",https://www.linkedin.com/in/biztechguru,"Orlando, Florida, United States","The spark that ignited my lifelong passion for technology came from an unexpected place – my high school dean's office. I can still picture that moment: slouching in the chair next to his desk as a student assistant, watching with fascination as he proudly showed me his website. He was selling scooters online – a side hustle before the term existed. In that ordinary office, on that ordinary day, I glimpsed a future I never knew was possible.

My technology journey, however, began long before that moment. In 1990, my father brought home our first IBM computer. While most families were still gathering around TV sets, we had this mysterious beige box. We had WordPerfect for documents and Lotus for spreadsheets—serious tools my parents needed for their business. But for me, I saw an opportunity.

That Christmas, I received a game that would change everything. Unlike today's plug-and-play world, this game required opening a command line and typing precise instructions: ""cd C:\folder\game.exe"". Each keystroke felt like I was speaking a secret language, commanding this machine to do my bidding. I was hooked by the game and the power of making technology bend to human will.

When eBay emerged years later, my Dean’s lesson came rushing back. That website he'd shown me wasn't just about selling scooters but about seeing possibilities where others saw obstacles. I began flipping items in an open market, learning the digital marketplace long before social media influencers taught ""side hustle culture."" Each successful sale wasn't just profit but validation that I could carve my path in this digital frontier.

My skills grew with the internet itself. From crafting websites in Adobe GoLive to building custom WordPress applications, I transformed from a curious student into a digital craftsman. Each new technology I mastered was another tool in my arsenal, another way to solve problems that businesses didn't even know they had.

Fast-forward over 25 years, and I own a Technology Consulting Agency, but it's more than just a business. It's the culmination of two loves: the entrepreneurial spirit my dean first showed me and the deep satisfaction of solving complex problems through technology. Every day, I help other dreamers bridge the gap between their business aspirations and the technical realities of our digital age.

Each solution we craft, each system we streamline, carries the echo of that first moment when I realized technology wasn't just about following instructions – it was about creating possibilities, and I thank my Dean, Coach Christian Dickinson for that.",34,,Founder and Chief Innovation Strategist,Grata Software · Self-employed,Chief Executive Officer,learntobuildabusiness.com,Chief Executive Officer,HuYu Media,University of Central Florida,"BSBA, Business Management, Entrepreneurship",Valencia College,"Associates of Arts, General Studies",Social Media Marketing,Content Strategy,Digital Marketing,Technology Integration,Web Development,2,,Guest on Exploring Growth Podcast discussing business growth and leadership; Featured on Invest in Sqft podcast,0,5.0,positive,,,,Pioneer in the plant-based sector with over 30 years of experience; Mission to inspire one million entrepreneurs to create 7-figure and 8-figure wealth by 2028,L2,"Based on the available information, Rey Ortega appears to be an early-stage entrepreneur with demonstrated technical experience and small business success, but without clear evidence of major exits, significant funding rounds, or scale achievements.

Cerebras Systems
Co-founder and CTO

I am co-founder and CTO of Cerebras Systems, a venture-backed stealth mode startup located in Menlo Park, California. I am proud to lend my 35 years of experience in computer architecture to this extraordinary team. 
Prior to co-founding Cerebras Systems, I was co-founder and CTO of SeaMicro.  SeaMicro (acquired by AMD for $355 million) was the pioneer in low power server technology. SeaMicro brought to life an idea I had been working on for 10 years and changed the trajectory of the server industry, by showing that it was possible to compete against the OEM using technical innovation.
Some career highlights: I was Chief Microprocessor Architect at Sun Microsystems for the UltraSparc III and UltraSparc IV. I was chief system architect of Sun DARPA HPCS supercomputer.   I am the author of more than 50 patents in computer architecture, I’ve held top secret clearance while I was designing radio jammers for the military, and in my spare time I do competitive RF engineering.

Petal,Active,Andrew Endicott,Co-Founding Partner at Gilgamesh | Fintech investor and founder,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewendicott,"New York, New York, United States","Hi, I'm Andrew! 

I spent my childhood in Arkansas, before heading to the University of Arkansas to study accounting and finance. I graduated right in the middle of the 2008 financial crisis.

After that, I stepped into the world of law, studying at Harvard and passing the bar in 2012.

I kicked off my career at Willkie Farr & Gallagher, a global law firm.  I got to work on big deals for all types of companies and even helped one of the first fintech company go public after the financial crisis.

As much as I loved working on deals, I wasn't a big fan of the red tape in law. I wanted to get closer to the transactions themselves, so I left law and moved to Lazard.

At Lazard, I got the chance to really dive into e-commerce and non-bank lending, learning the ins-and-outs of company valuations and business models. This experience helped me and a law school friend, create Petal in late-2015, a lending company for people with limited credit history.

Over the years, we raised about $700m in capital for Petal (debt + equity), hired a great team, and built a business generating revenues close to $100m. Early during this period, I starting investing with Miguel Armaza, and we co-founded Gilgamesh Ventures in 2020.  Since then, we've invested in 30 companies across the US, Brazil, and Mexico.

My journey with Petal also brought other things. A lifelong friend of mine and his partners bought a small bank in Arkansas, and I joined them as a board member and investor in 2019. It's been a privilege and a pleasure to work with them as they grow their brand and impact across the United States.

Youper,Active,Andrea Niles,CEO and Founder of Prospera | Maternal Mental Health,https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrea-niles-phd,"San Francisco, California, United States","I am currently the CEO and co-founder of Prospera, a mental health platform for women in pregnancy and postpartum.

My journey began as a clinical scientist, driven by a passion for understanding and treating anxiety and depression. I completed my PhD at UCLA, the #1 program in the country, under the mentorship of Dr. Michelle Craske, a world-renowned expert in anxiety and depression treatment. My research focused on behavioral therapies, aiming to uncover how these treatments work in an effort to improve their effectiveness. I published numerous papers in esteemed academic journals, poised to build a career as a leading scientist in mental health.

However, there was something missing for me in this career path. Despite significant advancements in our understanding of effective behavioral therapies, most people weren't receiving the treatments that work. The gap between scientific research and practical application is vast. I felt pulled to bridge this divide and make a tangible difference in mental health care in the real world.

Leaving the comfort of academia, I ventured into the growing field of digital mental health. I co-founded a company to develop a chatbot for anxiety and depression, designed to teach users evidence-based emotion regulation skills. I crafted the clinical content, strategized product positioning, and analyzed user data to enhance engagement and effectiveness.

Yet, it was clear that many app users needed more than a self-guided tool; they needed personalized support from a human to truly benefit from the new skills and make meaningful changes in their lives. Around this time, I became a mother and faced my own emotional challenges. This personal experience revealed a glaring gap in maternal mental health care, a profoundly underserved market.

Inspired, I co-founded Prospera with Dr. Sarah Stanger. Our mission: to eliminate barriers to accessing high-quality mental health support for mothers. Prospera combines digital tools with human coaching to deliver evidence-based interventions for perinatal mood and anxiety disorders. Our unique platform scales certified perinatal coaches, connecting them with thousands of women seeking support on their journey to motherhood.

Prospera will transform maternal mental health care, making it accessible, scalable, and affordable for every mother in need. My transition from academic to CEO was driven by a deep desire to bring evidence-based therapies out of the lab and into the lives of those who need them most, ensuring that every mother can get the help she needs when she needs it.",40,,CEO and Founder,Prospera Mental Health and Wellness · Full-time,Youper,3 yrs 2 mos,Founder,DMH Hub · Part-time,"University of California, Los Angeles","PhD, Clinical Psychology, Statistics, Health Psychology",UCLA,"BA, Psychology",Data Analysis,Teaching,Research Design,Psychology,Psychotherapy,3,Clinically Validated AI for Mental Healthcare recognition; Youper recognized for supporting healthcare providers and underserved students,Panelist in job interview during COVID-19 pandemic; Contributions to research on AI therapy for anxiety and depression,,7.0,positive,,,,Recipient of the Joseph Becker Research Award; 40+ peer reviewed publications; Invited speaker at national and international conferences,L3,"Andrea Niles demonstrates strong technical and academic credentials with her PhD from UCLA's top-ranked Clinical Psychology program, combined with research expertise and entrepreneurial ventures in digital health.

Not because I had a thing for geology — but because my hockey coach ran one. (I know, as small-town Canada as it gets.) 
 
In that world, he was my clearest example of what leadership looked like. Calm under pressure, respected by everyone, and always in control. I figured if I could be like him, I’d be on the right track.
 
That said, you’ll find that I never got into the mining business, but I did end up leading some pretty complex operations — just with less heavy machinery and more data.

Over the last 25+ years, I’ve led high-growth and high-change organizations across nearly every stage.

I helped scale Google Canada from $500M to over $2B in revenue. I led the turnaround at Evernote. I helped launch Glean from stealth to a category leader, and it’s now valued at $7.2B. I’ve also served on the boards of companies like Gap Inc., Tim Hortons, Planday, and Evernote, and I’ve invested in more than 20 innovative technology companies through Bobcaygeon Capital.

These days, I’m the CEO of GrowthLoop. And while we’re building software, what we’re really doing is helping marketers apply AI to optimize how they work. Traditional marketing has been slow, fragmented, and reliant on long back-and-forth loops between data and execution. We’re flipping that model.

GrowthLoop is pioneering Compound Marketing: a faster, AI-powered way of experimenting, learning, and improving performance that builds momentum over time. Just like compound interest, the gains add up. 

How did I end up here? A mix of curiosity, timing, resilience, and a strong bias toward action. And, truthfully, a competitive streak that’s never really gone away — a byproduct of being one of four kids.

I recently transitioned out of Revenoid (formerly EvaBot) after 11+ years of building and scaling the company. I’m now working on something new. Early days, but exciting.

•	Previously, at Revenoid, we were leveraging advanced language models (LLMs) to tackle key sales challenges like in-depth research and precise outreach. Our AI seamlessly integrates with CRM, outreach, and communication tools, providing sales teams with instant access to research insights and sales triggers. This allows them to proactively identify and address buyer pain points, fostering deeper connections and driving more impactful engagement.
•	Worked worked with my team on a next-generation smart virtual assistant. EvaBot Gifting not only facilitated sending the right gifts to clients but also served as a complete Customer Satisfaction and Happiness platform. It offered personalized, memorable incentives, improved feedback and survey (NPS) response rates, strengthened client relationship management, and enhanced brand recall.
•	Developed an innovative app that allows users to share personal videos with a private list and engage in video-based conversations. The experience is designed to encourage ongoing interaction through video content.
•	Managed iCouchApp, a mobile entertainment platform that powered major apps for well-known Indian media outlets, including Zee TV, HISTORY TV18, India TV, and more.
•	Led a multinational project at Final Quadrant, where I was actively involved as a Consultant and User Experience Designer for the LiveNetwrk project.
•	Led a team at Preseed, an initiative focused on research and development for entrepreneurship. Preseed nurtures early-stage startups, providing them with the tools and knowledge to succeed.
•	Founded BizOnTech, my second venture, specializing in end-to-end IT infrastructure solutions using open-source technologies. I later sold the company to serial entrepreneur Anuj Gupta.
•	Founded Nemonix, a venture born from my passion for photography, which I ran almost single-handedly for two years.
•	Earlier experience includes nearly three years as a Software Engineer at Cogent E Services Pvt Ltd., where I worked extensively with .NET, SQL Server 2005, and frameworks 2 and 3, contributing to substantial in-house development projects.
•	Photography is a deep passion of mine, driven by the desire to capture life in its purest form.

I spent my early career focusing on corporate finance, M&A, and financial analysis first at Prudential Financial and then at Loral Space & Communications, where I helped usher the company through various capital markets activities, including a $3.1B acquisition in the midst of the financial crisis. 

As Co-founder & CEO of Keen Home, I took the tech startup from pure concept to exit— navigating the company through a Techstars accelerator program, successfully appearing on ABC's Shark Tank, raising over $10M of capital, partnering with world class brands like Google, Amazon, and Samsung, and scaling the company to over 150K units sold en route to its eventual sale.

After Keen Home’s exit, I co-founded and served as the CEO of autom(8), where I led the charge to improve the way software is developed by launching the world’s first decentralized peer to peer Function as a Service platform. At autom(8), I forged strategic partnerships with Gitlab and Oracle and built an engaged developer community.

Post autom(8), I was the Head of Corp Dev at ConnectM Technology Solutions, where I was responsible for setting strategic direction, assessing M&A opportunities, and capital raising. I also set GTM strategy and drove product-led growth. At ConnectM, I successfully executed a home service provider roll-up and applied a connectivity and electrification thesis at scale which resulted in a 10X ROIC exit via de-SPAC after just 2 years.
 
After my first stint at ConnectM, I was on the founding team of Arbor, a venture-backed Public Benefit Corporation, where I developed a GTM playbook and led a team of B2B SaaS sales professionals to sell an AI-powered marketing platform into impact orgs, scaling the company to over $150K ARR 6 months post-launch.

Following Arbor, I joined the Silicon Valley-based venture studio, Portfolio T, as the CEO & Founder of a stealth mode startup in the sustainable food production space.

As an angel investor, startup coach, and frequent guest speaker, I enjoy discussing a variety of topics from fundraising and sales to authentic leadership.

About me:
I am a natural optimist. I have a tendency to look on the bright side of life and humanity.
I can see scenarios within and often just beyond the noise. 
I have always looked into the future but with tempered realism...what is important is the ability to execute in small meaningful steps. Map out a plausible path and be prepared to continuously adjust and adapt to the route along the way. Get through each day, week, and year having achieved something and having added some value to yourself, your activities, and those of others.
These many years, I have seen a lot of stops and starts, false promises, and ""creative"" marketing! This has tempered me with a better realpolitik: now best described as a “cynical optimism”... call it experience.

Some advice:
Do not lose sight or give up on your dreams. Continue to push and fight and sacrifice. 
Continue to balance work and family: without whom, nothing else matters. 
Surround yourself with demonstrably competent people to help in guidance and in decision making. Best practice is built upon tried and tested experience. Respect it, but it is not the law.
Question every perceived truth. It is never obvious nor are things certain. 
The business has to be practicable and _profitable_, in the end.
Be honorable, decisive, and unrepentant. But be respectful, kind to, and understanding of others and their points of view.

Other things:
If you have a young person who likes airplanes or spaceships, let me help inspire by taking them for a flight. I fly ""for the fun of it"" in the Ardennes: EBSP, in Pasadena: KEMT, and in Johannesburg: FAGM.
Founder of AspireSpace (1991-2000): British amateur rocketry, what a great education!
I was/am really good at theatrical lighting of artists in operas or theatrical productions. Enjoy the art.
My first engineering apprenticeship (1994-2000) was at Reaction Engines Ltd UK, with Alan Bond. The Skylon Spaceplane is still considered one of those transformative transportation technologies.

Richard Powers is a prescient leader who creatively orchestrates technology and people to cost-effectively produce beautifully efficient platforms that delight customers, create value drivers, grow revenue, and enable diverse new business opportunities.   

At WebOps, Richard focused on improving efficiency and rolling out enhancements to meet WebOps’ continued rapid growth by applying leading edge technology and development methodologies across all of the new and existing product lines.

At CardioMEMS, Richard's self-directed role transformation in a medical device startup took him from sensor R&D to user interface development, to marketing management, and, ultimately, to creating the flagship healthcare portal and architecting the powerful cloud infrastructure that is the heart of the CardioMEMS heart failure management system. The platform was a key value proposition in what was ultimately an acquisition deal valued at over $450 million. 

Under his leadership at CardioMEMS, Richard and his team designed and developed a secure, cloud-based, remote healthcare monitoring disease management IoT platform powering the world’s first FDA-approved implantable wireless blood pressure sensor for patients with heart failure. The ISO-27001 certified Ruby on Rails based platform allows physicians to monitor patients’ pulmonary artery pressure trends and use this information to adjust their medications, thereby avoiding hospitalizations. Richard demonstrated prescience by developing the platform utilizing virtualization and open-source technology before the industry was talking about “the cloud”.

I'm an alumnus of YCombinator (W14), an Endeavor Entrepreneur, Fulbright Scholar and was featured on Fortune's 40 under 40. Before Bunch, I built and exited 2 startups (Boostable and SocialWire) and was a venture partner at 500 Startups. 

As a Venture Partner / EIR at 500 Startups, I supported the accelerator program in San Francisco, helped them expand their operations into Canada, and lead investments such as StackShare and TurnStyle (acq. by Yelp). During this time, I've also co-founded the startup studio 500 LABS with support from 500 Startups to incubate new companies from the ground up. 500 LABS eventually became Bunch. 

Prior to that, I co-founded Boostable. Based in San Francisco and funded by notable silicon valley investors like YCombinator, SVAngel, and 500 Startups, Boostable helped online marketplaces offer digital marketing services to their sellers. Boostable was acquired by Metric Collective. 

Before that, I founded SocialWire (later renamed Manifest) that helped some of the largest retailers automate their products ads. Funded by First Round Capital, SofttechVC, and 500 Startups, Manifest was a recipient of Facebook’s innovation awards in 2013. Manifest was acquired by Rakuten Marketing. 

I also co-founded Nomadic Mentors, a non-profit that connects top mentors in silicon valley with founders in emerging tech hubs around the world. Nomadic Mentors was acquired by The Family, one of the most successful accelerators in Europe.

I'm also lead singer and songwriter for The HMMS:

✘ Unmet sales quotas
✘ Weak customer relationships
✘ Small sales pipeline

These problems have only grown more prominent in the age of social media, where the plain text doesn’t cut through the clutter in the inbox, even with existing clients.

Today’s buyers demand modern sellers who understand their digitally connected, mobile attached, social media engagement, video-driven environment. Sales, marketing, and customer success must all use an omnichannel approach to break through the noise, including email, phone, text, social media, and video.
It’s difficult to push a deal to close with so many challenges coming at you all at once. The pandemic, changing buyer preferences, and an evolving Internet are just some of these challenges.

The leveraging of video has helped companies stay ahead of their competition, but it takes the right know-how to use video for sales effectively.

As a Sales Leader, I have first-hand experience of how to engage customers in an age where attention is priceless, and most people browse the Internet on their phones. It means using multiple channels for prospecting, and video is one of them.

Think about this:

If your sales emails aren’t getting many clicks…

And your landing pages aren’t getting many either...

Then why keep doing more of the same?

In 2021, Hippo Video was rated as a High Performer and a Leader in Video Hosting, Video Email, and Sales Engagement by G2, the world’s largest tech marketplace.

We’ve also helped 5000+ businesses accelerate their sales pipeline and build rock-solid customer relationships with both new and existing customers, some of them fortune 500 companies.

In my own time, I enjoy being with my family, reading, and walking in the parks. And yes, I do enjoy watching Netflix.

I have had a winding career path spanning astrophysics, data science, and product management, and I have worked in various industries, including healthcare, agriculture, and Earth Observation.

Originally from Indiana, I earned a Ph.D. in Astronomy from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, where I designed and built specialized solutions to detect galaxies in the early Universe from low signal-to-noise imagery. I also held a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory, where I supported the commissioning of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array in Chile.

After transitioning into data science, I co-founded Astraea, a startup developing an AI platform for big geospatial data. As the VP of Data Science, I led a team of data scientists in building ML solutions using satellite imagery data. My projects included leveraging satellite data and computer vision to detect undocumented cement and steel plants, track the growth of solar farms, and classify crop types. I later worked as the VP of Data Science at the AgTech startup EarthOptics, where I led data science and software teams in building scalable ML solutions. My key accomplishments included implementing automated MLOps pipelines for our products and managing the design, development, and launch of a soil sampling app. Most recently, I was the Senior Technical Director for the US Public Sector at Pixxel Space Technologies, where I led the technical execution of government programs.

Rasa,Active,Melissa Gordon,Founder & CEO @ Rasa: Superfunctional Coffee Alternatives,https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordonmelissa,"Boulder, Colorado, United States","Founder & CEO of Rasa. Mom of 2 boys. Lifelong seeker of health and boundless energy. 

My life has taken some wide turns, but I've always had an obsession with energy.

After dropping out of college, I moved to Costa Rica to caretake a wildlife refuge in virgin rainforest. There was no electricity, and the nearest 100-person town was a two hour boat ride away. I once walked 5 hours to make a phone call, fording a river known to have crocodiles to get there. I was surrounded by both beautiful and deadly things. I became intimate with the power of nature, and developed a profound respect for its energy and our place within it.

In my early 20s, I took initiation into a Kashmiri Shaivite Tantra lineage, and spent the better part of a decade in deep study and practice of Yoga, Ayurveda, & meditation—spending a total of 6 months in retreat. Midway through that journey, I felt the pull to bring my practice into more direct benefit of the world at large.

I went on to co-found two climate solution companies, worked with Richard Branson’s Carbon War Room, lobbied at the United Nations, spoke at TEDxBerkley, traveled to a total of 26 countries, and, finally, started Rasa.

I started Rasa during the most stressful year of my life—I had inadvertently joined (and quite advertently left!) a cult, had emergency back surgery, moved across-country, lost a family member, had an emergency Cesarean birth, and a huge fallout with my family…& now had a baby.

I needed something to keep me going, but when I tried coffee, it left me with jitters, anxiety, and even worse sleep. Hard nope. And the available coffee alternatives either weren't energizing enough or weren't delicious enough.

I saw a market opportunity and partnered with an herbalist to create Rasa: coffee alternatives that use herbs instead of caffeine to energize. And are freaking delicious. 

At Rasa, we're here to transform the way you energize—and set a new standard for sustainable business…with love. What started with me elbow-deep blending herbs in my kitchen has now served over 10 million cups worldwide. Join us!

Trials.ai,Active,Michael Nicoletti,Senior Technical Program Manager | AI/ML | Human-Machine Teaming | System Design and Testing | Test Design and Execution | High-Performance Team Builder,https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-nicoletti-872a09a,"Johnston, Rhode Island, United States","I’m a Senior Technical Program Manager and AI Scientist with over 20 years of experience developing scalable, ground-up solutions by deeply understanding customer needs. My work spans technology evaluation, AI/ML systems, human-machine teaming, and the leadership of complex prototype programs where schedule, budget, and risk must be continuously negotiated.

My past clients include DARPA, AFRL, ONR, IARPA, the U.S. Navy, NSF, and other R&D-driven agencies. These programs have forged my ability to execute under pressure and deliver first-of-a-kind capabilities from concept through field testing. Nothing proves readiness quite like a test at sea.

I approach technical leadership through the lens of three critical groups:

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) — understanding their context, workflows, and constraints
End Users — aligning development with real-world utility and feedback loops
The Dev Team — knowing your team’s strengths, blind spots, and bandwidth to surface risk early

I’ve led multi-million dollar efforts across human-machine interfaces, LLM testbeds (Retrieval Augmented Generation), wearable sensors, and complex signal processing systems including sonar, seismic, and laser vibrometry. I aim to build trust through execution, transparency, and consistent delivery.

As I transition into commercial ventures, I bring the discipline, creativity, and systems thinking forged in high-stakes government R&D. I’m looking for a mission-driven company where I can lead AI-enabled programs from vision to deployment, driving impact while building healthy, high-performance teams.

Some of my favorite highlights (that I can share):

More about me:
Born to a Japanese father and American mother, I grew up in both Japan and the U.S., giving me a multicultural perspective that has shaped my approach to innovation.

My passion for emerging technologies began in 2013 when I discovered cryptocurrencies and blockchain, inspiring me to pivot from Computer Science to Quantitative Economics. Around the same time, I encountered VR while serving as Assistant Curator for the UC San Diego Film Festival. After experiencing early technologies like Google Cardboard and HTC Vive, I realized Spatial Computing (XR) and its transformative potential and decided to dedicate myself to this field.

In 2015, I co-founded Nanome, a company at the forefront of using VR to accelerate scientific discovery. Collaborating with Structural Biologists, Medicinal Chemists, and Protein Engineers has given me a deep appreciation for in silico drug discovery and the challenges researchers face. I am passionate about using VR to revolutionize workflows and unlock new possibilities for scientific innovation.

I thrive on working at the intersection of technology and science, and I’m always looking for opportunities to push boundaries and make meaningful impacts.",37,,COO,Nanome Inc.,CFO and Product Manager,nanoVR,Filmatic Curitorial and Video Production Assistant,ArtPower at UC San Diego,UC San Diego,"Bachelor’s Degree, B.S.

Astarte Medical,Closed,Tammi Jantzen,"CFO of Portfolia, Kauffman Fellow",https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammi-jantzen,"Platteville, Wisconsin, United States","In a business reference a few years ago, I was compared to a classic “utility infielder.” I was told that I have the versatility of being willing and able to cover the basics and then transition my game to more complex, creativity-demanding decisions with skill and balance, and illustrate that rare quality with not only agile intellect, but the requisite agile attitude so important to real, fast-paced, and high-ramification decision-making and execution.

Throughout my career, I have been blessed to work alongside some amazing people and this skillset has proven effective time and time again. I’m thrilled to be working with the incredible team at Portfolia, utilizing these skills once more. Portfolia unites and empowers women to invest in companies that will enhance our lives, create wealth, and build a better world. I’m excited to use my expertise to positively impact this important mission.

As a CPA, I’ve always found pleasure in all things accounting, and I spent 15 years as CFO of three early-stage venture capital funds. But I realized I wanted to do something more. To help with the transition from ops to investing, I applied and was accepted to the Kauffman Fellows program, a leadership program for the VC industry to develop innovation leaders to support entrepreneurs in their mission to change the world.

I began seeking out companies to invest in that were focused on women’s and children’s health and wellbeing – an area I am super passionate about and a largely underserved area of innovation and investment. Then the entrepreneurial shift happened. I co-founded a company to improve health in the first 1,000 days of life from conception to age two. I learned that building a company from an idea requires grit, versatility, humor, patience, long hours, and an occasional glass of wine. 

Today, I’m excited to use all of my experiences as fund CFO, investor, entrepreneur, and operating company CFO to work with the Portfolia team. Portfolia creates investment funds designed for women, backing innovative companies we want in the world for returns and impact.

I think the classic utility player comparison holds true. I’m happy to be in the background supporting all the awesomeness going on around me. Doing what it takes to make my team successful. I’m interested in building relationships through a combination of trust, mutual respect, collaboration, reliability and the willingness to put in the hard work that it takes to build sustainable businesses that make a difference in the world.",56,,Chief Financial Officer,Portfolia,Astarte Medical,9 yrs 4 mos,Kauffman Fellow,Kauffman Fellows,University of Wisconsin-Platteville,"Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Accounting",,,Analysis,Business Strategy,Due Diligence,Entrepreneurship,Financial Analysis,3,,Interview with FemTech Insider; Featured in The Story Exchange; Interview with Kauffman Fellows Journal,0,6.0,positive,,,,,L4,"Tammi Jantzen demonstrates significant executive experience as a CFO across multiple ventures, including venture capital funds and startups.

I’m currently co-founder of Lunch, a fintech company helping government vendors access working capital through embedded finance. We scaled from zero to $800k ARR in six months, raised $5M in venture capital and over $100M in debt to fund early payment programs across multiple states.

Before that, I founded Reely, an AI/computer vision startup in 2015. We developed real-time highlight automation for the sports industry—serving over 125 customers, including collegiate athletic departments, sports leagues, and broadcasters. We were an early mover in AI and computer vision were successfully acquired.

As GM at PlayVS I ran operations for more than 2,000 school districts and helped the company achieve 100% YoY retention during a period of rapid growth in the esports space.

I have significant venture capital and private equity experience both on the founder side as well as from my time at Two Bear Capital, supporting portfolio companies and diligencing investments in AI, bio, and frontier tech.

And for 25 years, I served in the U.S. Air Force, retiring as a Lieutenant Colonel and C-17 pilot with leadership experience in high-stakes, high-tempo environments.

Reely,Active,Jeshua Joseph,Bringing back authentic communication to the world!,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeshuabenjoseph,"Seaside, Oregon, United States","From a young age, I was obsessed with efficiency and automation. I saw the potential of technology to transform the way we work and live, and I dove headfirst into the world of software development. I've led DevOps transformations and automation projects at some of the biggest companies on the planet – Google, Ford, Ericsson – you name it, I've probably been there. I've mastered the entire software stack, from the front-end to the back-end, and I've always been driven to find better, faster, and more efficient ways to do things.

But my journey hasn't been without its setbacks. I've had more failed businesses, ideas, and products than I care to count. Each failure, though, was a lesson in disguise. It taught me resilience, resourcefulness, and the importance of learning from mistakes. I devoured books like ""Think and Grow Rich,"" immersing myself in the philosophies of success and leadership. I sought out mentors, studied the greats, and gradually honed my skills as an entrepreneur.

Then, a few years ago, a spark ignited. I had this idea for a new way to connect with people – a way that was more authentic, more engaging, and more ""real"" than anything else out there. I called it Garland, and it was a prototype for what would eventually become Reely. I shared it with my close friends and family, and we used it to stay connected, to share our lives, and to have real conversations.

Life, as it often does, threw me a curveball. I got busy with work, with other projects, and Garland was put on the back burner. Then, the tech industry took a downturn, and I lost all my contracts. It was a devastating blow, but it was also a wake-up call. I realized that I needed to reinvent myself, to take all the lessons I had learned, and to finally bring my vision for Reely to life.

I spent the last two years on a journey of self-mastery. I delved deep into personal development, mindfulness, and leadership. I emerged from this period with a renewed sense of purpose and a rock-solid foundation for success.

Now, I'm ready to take Reely to the top. I'm ready to compete with the major players, to disrupt the social media landscape, and to create a platform where people can truly connect and express themselves. I'm not afraid of the challenges ahead, because I know that with my experience, my passion, and my unwavering determination, Reely will succeed.

This is more than just another app; it's a culmination of my life's work, my failures, my triumphs, and my unwavering belief in the power of human connection.

Concertio,Active,Tomer Morad,AI-Powered Performance Optimization - We're hiring!,https://www.linkedin.com/in/morad,"New York, New York, United States","I’m a highly motivated, creative, and multi-disciplinary serial entrepreneur. I love creating things from scratch and seeing them succeed: I’ve co-founded Concertio (acquired by Synopsys) and transSpot, as well as three other startups with part-time involvement. I’ve also worked for two other startups and a large technical unit in the government sector.

I love technology and sciences, and I've been programming from a very young age. I earned my PhD in Electrical Engineering (Computer Architecture), which led me to move with my family to NYC to join the Runway program at the Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute of Cornell Tech and start my new venture, Concertio. Somehow I've always dealt with performance optimization throughout my career, which is why I was so excited to start Concertio - we provided AI-Powered Performance Optimization software for boosting performance and slashing costs. Following Concertio's acquisition, I am continuing this path in the context of the Silicon Lifecycle Management (SLM) space.

My journey started in civil and structural engineering, leading global infrastructure projects across Energy, Water, and Industrial sectors. Since then, I’ve led enterprise SaaS companies—both public and private—as CEO and board advisor, focused on driving systemic transformation through AI and automation.

Today, I serve as CEO of Swarm Engineering, where we build agentic AI systems that enable enterprises to automate complex decisions and unlock new levels of efficiency and resilience. AI isn’t a bolt-on. It’s the logic layer shaping how organizations operate in real time.

This isn’t gradual progress—it’s a leap. Technologies like federated learning and constraint-based reasoning are enabling smarter, decentralized decision systems across the supply chain and beyond.

My second book, Agentic Artificial Intelligence, became an Amazon #1 Best Seller at launch, exploring how AI is shifting from passive tools to autonomous collaborators.  It builds on my first book, Intelligent Automation, which remains widely used in both industry and academia.

At my core, I think like a strategic operator—fusing systems thinking with executional clarity. Whether I’m writing, building, or advising, my focus is simple: compress complexity, elevate outcomes, and challenge conventional limits.

dreyev,Active,Malgorzata Stys,CEO and CoFounder at dreyev,https://www.linkedin.com/in/malgorzatastys,New York City Metropolitan Area,"I am passionate about the convergence of AI, safety, and human-centered design, and I am proud to lead dreyev—an AI-driven platform that is revolutionizing driving safety and insurance. At the heart of dreyev is a commitment to collaborative driving, where technology partners with drivers to enhance safety and create a more connected, efficient driving experience.

With the rapid growth of connected devices and AI, we now have the power to prevent accidents, protect drivers, and enable smarter, fairer insurance pricing. Over the last decade, AI has transformed industries, and I’m excited to be part of this shift in the auto insurance sector. While telematics are commonly used to collect data, the true innovation lies in driver coaching—dreyev integrates IoT, Smart Sensors, and AI not just to reduce claims, but to proactively mitigate risks through a collaborative approach with drivers.

dreyev’s human-centric design ensures that our solutions are intuitive, supportive, and effective. By providing real-time monitoring and coaching, we empower drivers to stay focused and safe, while fostering positive driving habits. We believe in a partnership between driver and technology—where the system not only corrects but also encourages safe driving behavior in a non-intrusive, motivating way. This approach not only improves safety but also allows insurers to offer more accurate, risk-based pricing, ensuring fairness and transparency.

As a co-founder of dreyev LLC, my mission is simple: reduce preventable crashes and save lives. Our real-time driver attention monitoring, coaching, and management system helps drivers remain alert, preventing distractions and drowsiness. This collaborative environment between driver and technology is key to creating a safer, more efficient driving experience for everyone.

Trained as an economist, I was naturally drawn to data—and that led me straight into the wild and wonderful world of AI. I found my true passion in bringing creative, AI-driven solutions to life—solutions that help companies and individuals achieve more with less effort.

Over the past decade, I’ve co-founded and scaled multiple startups, from early mobile gaming ventures at Scopely to AI-powered recruiting at Celential.ai. At Celential, we raised $10M in VC funding, scaled to hundreds of customers, reached multi-million ARR, and ultimately exited to Wellfound (formerly AngelList Talent). Along the way, I built a recruitment platform that tapped into 100M professional profiles and, more importantly, created the world’s largest talent graph of engineers. Working with massive datasets, designing intelligent algorithms, and automating results at scale—that’s the kind of magic I live for.

My journey into HR tech started with Good&Co, where I helped scale our user base from 100K to 1.5M by drastically improving retention and virality—key levers for organic growth. More importantly, we built one of the largest culture graphs of U.S. companies, leveraging psychometric data from millions of professionals to match people with work environments where they thrive.

My startup career actually began in college when I founded a healthcare data company. At the time, EHR adoption was booming, but the expected flood of healthcare data wasn’t driving better outcomes. So, I tried to break the dam. Raised $1.5M, built a dedicated team, and onboarded 1M+ patient records through partnerships. And then? I shut it down. Turns out, it was a lot harder than I thought. A worthy goal—hopefully, someone will crack it one day.

I’ve also spent time in gaming, launching top titles at Zynga and Scopely that collectively hit 50M+ installs and $100M+ in revenue. Running live ops for games was the ultimate crash course in product management—balancing engagement, retention, and monetization in real time. The lessons I took from building delightful, high-performing products apply everywhere, from consumer apps to B2B SaaS.

At my core, I love building, tinkering, trying new things—and yes, breaking them. I believe knowledge is meant to be shared, and that true competition isn’t about gatekeeping, but about who can create, iterate, and push forward with the most energy and resilience.

Health and performance have been central to my life from the beginning. As a college athlete, I meticulously tracked performance metrics—a pursuit that deepened my curiosity about the systems behind success and sparked a lifelong journey. This journey has taken me from the sidelines as a coach to the lab as a physician and into boardrooms as a CEO building innovative solutions.

I began my career coaching collegiate and professional athletes at Cal, UCLA, and beyond, where data-driven coaching contributed to gold medals, national championships, and professional titles. Witnessing the limitations of traditional approaches to injury prevention, I pursued a medical degree from USC, conducting biomechanics research to better understand human performance.

Bridging medical science and performance training, I founded Sparta Software Corporation to integrate data, technology, and coaching into actionable solutions for global sports teams, military units, and healthcare organizations. As CEO, I scaled the company from a small team to 60 employees before its acquisition by Oura in 2024.

Today, I’m focused on unifying technology, data, and intuition to simplify the complexities of human performance, helping teams and organizations achieve exceptional outcomes. I believe the future of health lies at the intersection of innovation and intuition, and I’m dedicated to driving this evolution globally.

Lead scoring and ""in-market"" intent signals are inaccurate and based on human bias. For example, 88% of high intent visitors aren’t on your pricing page, and the visitors on your pricing page aren’t necessarily buyers. Yet many tools track pricing page views as buyer intent.

I love being connected to impactful problems that require novel technology, I feel most engaged when building technology that's never been done before and I share that excitement with my team.

As an engineer, I've always been a generalist. I build full-stack web applications that make complicated things simple-- at CrowdAI I built the first version of our no-code computer vision platform in React.js, Ruby on Rails and Python. I love an environment where I'm surrounded by people who are smarter than me. I get joy out of a well-maintained software ecosystem: monitoring, CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code.

As a leader, my job is to hire and retain incredibly talented, low-ego people, giving them clear goals and a flexible environment. I look for opportunities to provide mentorship and I frequently solicit feedback-- I'm never done growing and neither should anyone else be. Every role should be designed around goals rather than prescribed process.

As an entrepreneur, I'm used to taking a lot of ownership. When things start to click for the business, a thousand tiny problems emerge-- dealing with these as quickly as you notice them keeps the team focused. Find repeatability everywhere that problems recur, but design every process to grow from stakeholder feedback. In a startup, it's critical to know when to build things right vs when to build them fast. Rapid prototypes, 80/20 solutions and ""fail fast"" where appropriate.

I want to help them survive, so they can eventually thrive. Everything we do at Tight has that end goal in mind.

Business owners and operators generally focus so much energy on growing revenue that they often overlook the importance of keenly keeping an eye on their expenses, profitability and taxes. Tight’s embedded accounting products make this seamless and enable small businesses to focus on profitable growth.

I’m a long-term thinker, focused on what is down the road, not just the present. I’m passionate about entrepreneurship and small businesses — these are the folks that create the majority of jobs in our communities. Every business owner should have access to simple tools and the financial education they need to succeed.

Via our white-labeled embedded accounting features inside our small business-focused partner platforms – including fintechs, banks, and vertical SaaS providers — we’ve helped businesses of all types (and entity types). From those just incorporating their business to those with tens of employees on payroll, from creators to coffee shops, HVAC services to churches, and rental properties to legal practices, the goal is to help all small businesses thrive financially.

I’m proud that in my various business endeavors, people choose to come along for the journey. People who worked with us at VisualHOMES now work with us here at Tight. There’s great value in that continuity, both for the business and on a personal level.

I believe Generative AI is the most profound technological disruption since the invention of the internet. It’s not just hype—when applied thoughtfully, GenAI can fundamentally transform how enterprises operate, how people work, and how decisions are made. That belief drives everything we do at Inference Analytics: building secure, enterprise-ready AI that doesn't just sound smart—it actually delivers real results.

We were early. Back in 2019, long before ChatGPT or foundation models became household names, we published research on AI-powered text generation for clinical use cases in IEEE. Since then, we’ve built a platform used by over 2,000 professionals across hospitals and are now scaling into manufacturing, life sciences, and other regulated industries where trust, compliance, and performance matter.

Before Inference Analytics, I led product and business units at some of the biggest names in data and analytics.

My odds started at 90% to beat cancer but ended up at 30% before trying this last treatment. 

The treatment that worked, the treatment that saved my life, and gave me my life back had the acronym: B-E-A-M. This is the reason behind the name and the true mission for BEAM is to help everyone and anyone BE AMAZING.

This allows us to put 100% of our resources into the product, but it does not stop there. Quality to us is of the utmost importance so we do in-house allergen, metal, and efficacy testing along with 3rd party testing.

In 1982, Fereydoun started a company developing a smart switch to function as a phone system working with personal computers which had just been introduced to the market by IBM.  Once the VC investment did not materialize, Fereydoun redirected R&D to transform the product to voice mail, interactive voice response with voice recognition, and fax servers. After several successful years with increasing sales the company merged with a telecom manufacture and went public.  Later on in his career, Fereydoun co-founded a number of companies in various areas of technologies including Java development tools, knowledge management, and information discovery, network monitoring and security. Today, Fereydoun has founded a new company developing AI driven IOT healthcare devices using a fusion of sensors.

Helping B2B SMEs, tech & consulting firms achieve 60% cost reduction through proven AI Systems Engineering

The current AI hype is focused on generative models, but building real business value with AI runs much deeper. For more than 8 years, my team and I have been on the front lines of enterprise automation, long before the generative AI wave of 2022.

Our journey with InnovareAI began as an innovation consulting firm. We saw that the biggest challenge for companies wasn't just strategy, but execution. This insight led us to pivot into B2B workflow automation in 2020, where we built our own proprietary SaaS platform to automate complex sales and marketing processes.

When generative AI emerged, we were perfectly positioned. We pioneered AI Systems Engineering by fusing these powerful new models with the automation engine we've spent years perfecting. This is our key difference: we don't just layer on new AI tools; we integrate them into a proven, reliable system.

We specialize in empowering B2B SMEs, tech companies, and consulting firms – from innovative startups to established enterprises. Our clients include IFC Impact Finance Center, Seattle Angel Conference, Asphericon, Deutsche Telekom, DocuSign, Compusafe, and Dewetron, among many others.

This consultative, systems-first approach allows us to deliver real-world results:

► Strategic AI Roadmapping: Building custom implementation plans that align with your core business goals.
► Autonomous Agent Deployment: Deploying intelligent AI teams that handle complex tasks in sales and operations.
► Intelligent Workflow Integration: Weaving AI into your existing tech stack for maximum efficiency.

The results of this long-term, foundational approach are clear. With nearly 1300 successful AI automation projects delivered, our clients have seen:

💡 60% reduction in operational costs.
💡 75% increase in qualified leads.
💡 10x scaling of content production.

I'm also the technical co-founder of 3cubed.ai, where we help life sciences and healthcare organizations become AI-first. Our focus is on creating bespoke AI solutions that deliver measurable impact in complex, regulated environments.

If you're ready to move beyond the hype and build a true AI-powered operation with a seasoned partner, I'd love to connect.

This is why being a team player and creating unbelievable cultures for businesses is extremely stimulating and a love of mine. I believe in inspiration, encouragement, and treating developers as responsible adults.

I have experience in many industries that includes toys, entertainment (visual effects), eCommerce pharma and legal tech. My passion is for creating products that are challenging and beautiful. I know how to build and scale business while balancing cost, quality and time. I lead tight ships of highly motivated developers and I am very hands-on in the process as well. 

My focus is:
• Team building.
• Supporting and mentoring engineers. 
• Researching, planning and integrating business operation technologies.
• Working using TDD, Agile (Scrum), Continuous Integration.
• Creating engineering goals, plans and company strategy.
• Architecting and supervise building high performing platforms.
• Communicating tech problems and solutions effectively to non-tech company members.

Under my leadership, my teams have launched several products including mobile Apps featured on the Apple App Store, pioneering VR and computer vision applications and Machine learning and analytics tools. I have taken on a couple of entrepreneurial projects of my own such as a social network and a couple of mobile apps.

After working 10 years in Computer Science research around static analysis, he shifted his focus to the creation of urban planning software, including land use models, accessibility analysis and procedural geometry, joining a team in UC Berkeley, California. Then, he co-founded Synthicity, a startup that created a new generation of city modeling software merging land use models and generative design. Synthicity was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2015.

In 2016, under the idea that there was more to do to make land use models available to a broader public, he co-founded UrbanSim Inc, growing revenue from $ 0 to $ 4M in a few years, and putting together a team of 25 employees, including software developers, planners and data scientists.

In 2022, decides to fully focus on behavioral visual models, to add traceability and accuracy to land use planning tools allowing high precision forecasts, which dramatically expand their field of application. 

Federico co-founds Urbanly LLC, a nimble startup with a highly skilled team of specialists significantly improving the type of questions that cities, MPOs and Real Estate developers are able to answer about urban futures.

In the technical side, Federico has developed Boost C++ libraries, and reviewed for Microsoft's Protocol Engineering & Documentation initiative.

Turned out I went the whole other direction, and I didn’t regret it for a second. 

I made the big switch while i was doing my bachelor’s degree in NMCT and went from going home developing my projects after school to a student’s job as a door to door seller. I didn’t know if it would be something for me, as I wasn’t quite the most social and convincing person, but what I did know that it was something I wanted really bad. And may that be the main reason why I just did it, and it worked! Instead of being busy with webdevelopment, I became busy with self development. Within 2 years in the company I went from being a door to door seller to teamleader to salesmanager of the branch in Kortrijk to starting up my own branch from scratch in Bruges as a Branchmanager. With my own office, having the end responsibility over 30-40 people, I really learned to start thinking out of the ‘you’ instead of the ‘I’. Interviewing and 1-to-1-ing, hiring and firing, training and coaching, creating salesculture and a happy workplace were some of the most important tasks filling my daily agenda. Throughout those times I discovered what I really love the most: the coaching, inspiring and training of people who want to be succesfull in a direct sales environment. Because all of these people reminded me of myself back in time, someone who wanted to, but didn’t know how. 

Even till today I still hold several sales records in door to door selling going from ‘within the company’ to ‘national’ and ‘international’.

I'm responsible for developing sales and marketing strategies and implementation. Prior to Tocaro Blue, my background is in professional motorsports, both as a driver and professional driving coach. Succeeding in motorsports forces you to push your comfort zone, quickly learn new skills, and develop strong relationships. Every skill I possess today, I owe to my background in motorsport. 

APEX Pro was created to give grassroots racers access to powerful data in a simple way. Through APEX Pro, I learned how to develop both hardware and software products, both of these skills directly translated to my work with MOXIE IoT. MOXIE developed custom hardware and software products for clients in a variety of industries. I worked to find new clients, build relationships, and structure agreements to help suit their needs.

With MOXIE IoT I got to learn how innovative individuals and companies think about opportunities and solutions to problems, and then help them bring those solutions to life. My role is to network with technologists and entrepreneurs, and bring them to our team for help in designing products.

In September 2023, MOXIE was acquired by Tocaro Blue. I can't be more excited to focus on our revenue growth and sales efforts, as well as continue supporting the product development and customer feedback elements of the business. Exciting times!

Throughout my career, I've embraced challenging projects that not only draw upon my skills and experiences but also push me toward further growth and learning. As a professional writer and editor, I've spent years honing my craft. However, my journey as an international explorer of life—from stretching towards the unknown in my airline management career, my sailing career, or as a professional in the art industry—has equally shaped my professional endeavors.

Originally from Denmark and now a long-time California resident, my life has been a blend of two cultures, two home countries, and two languages. This unique perspective enriches all I do, reminding me there is always another perspective.

From a young age, I've been fascinated by the power of our minds, leading me to explore various spiritual teachings and practices. This obsession has not only guided my personal evolution but also directed my professional path.

My most recent venture involves synthesizing all my acquired knowledge, experiences, and skills into a new framework, sharing what I have learned to achieve Inner mastery:

o	Our thoughts and feelings create our life experiences and reality.

o	The importance of emotional intelligence and social life skills (I spent five years writing curricula 
        books for elementary school children, and founded www.innerweather.com for adults).

o	Heart-brain coherence and applying our heart's intelligence to inner well-being (I'm a certified 
        HeartMath Mentor in Building Personal Resilience).

As the founder of InnerWeather Explorer, I offer tools and insights from three transformative perspectives—mental mastery, emotional intelligence, and heart coherence. My goal is to facilitate a deeper engagement with the internal states of my client-partners, helping them achieve lasting emotional and cognitive balance.

I provide guidance on adjusting the internal thermostat between your mind’s and heart’s intelligence, equipping you with tools and insights accessible anytime, anywhere.

I continue to write and edit on a wide range of topics, including those above and beyond. Whether you need a guest writer for your publication or blog, an article on a specific subject, or simply wish to explore a personal writing project, I'm here to help.

As VP of Investment Banking, I was the lead underwriter for 3 of the 4 largest public companies in Canada.  I helped raise +US$4B in Canada, the US, and Europe.  I left investment banking and started a VC fund in Montreal, investing in startup tech, three companies of which went public, one 24 years later!  After 15 years in finance, I decided to run companies rather than finance them.

I helped turn a 3-man team into a premier programming tools vendor, Metrowerks CodeWarrior, which earned the award Software Product of the Year from MacWorld Mag.  CodeWarrior was used to build the vast majority of software in popular use on the Macintosh in the 1990s.  MacWeek said Metrowerks saved Apple Computer!  MacWorld awarded me a World Class Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Macintosh Platform.  I was a Finalist for the E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year Award/Austin.  Metrowerks was acquired by Motorola.

Subsequently, Motorola named me VP Biz Dev for their semiconductor business, where I invested over $450M in M&A in 14 months.  After Motorola, I started a data science-based supply chain software company focused on the F500, including Walmart, CVS, Best Buy, and McLane.  20% of our staff were Masters/PhDs in OR and math.

- Austin Business Journal - Founder/CEO of No. 1 fastest growing company in Austin TX / 2010

I am currently co-founder / CEO of Cerebri AI Inc. ( Austin, Toronto, Washington DC ). What a great team, my second data science startup, it never gets old, what a revolution. 35 awesome data scientists and S/W engineers and staff, our flagship AI software is Cerebri AI CVX v3.

I started my career with PwC, working in Ottawa and Paris.  After the graduating from the LSE, I joined Wood Gundy ( CIBC World Markets ). As VP Investment Banking, I was lead underwriter for 3 of the 4 largest public companies in Canada.  I helped raise +US$4B in Canada, US and Europe. I left investment banking and started a VC fund in Montreal, investing in startup tech, three companies of which went public, one 24 years later!  After 15 yrs in finance, I decided to run companies rather than finance them.

I helped turn a 3-man team into a premier programming tools vendor, Metrowerks CodeWarrior, was Software Product of the Year by MacWorld Mag. CodeWarrior was used to build the vast majority of software in popular use on the Macintosh in the 1990s. MacWeek said Metrowerks saved Apple Computer! MacWorld awarded me a World Class Award for Outstanding Contribution to the Macintosh Platform.  I was Finalist: E&Y Entrepreneur of the Year Award/Austin. Metrowerks was acquired by Motorola.

Subsequently, Motorola named me VP Biz Dev for their semiconductor business, where I invested over $450M in M&A in 14 months. After Motorola, I started a data science based supply chain software company focused on the F500 including Walmart, CVS, Best Buy, and McLane. 20% of our staff were Masters/PhDs in OR and and math.

Active Investor.  M&A Junkie.  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Currently I am CEO of Flipside Crypto, which provides business intelligence for blockchain organizations.  Previously I led the Transactions (M&A and Partnerships) Team at Pluralsight, which  I joined via the acquisition of Smarterer, a venture backed skills assessment startup I co-founded in 2010 and led as CEO since 2013.  

I founded BzzAgent in 2001, a social marketing company that accelerates word of mouth to drive sales.  BzzAgent was acquired in 2011 by dunnhumby, a division of Tesco PLC.  Post acquisition, I acted as Global Head of Investments for dunnhumby and served on the organization's Global Executive Team until late 2013, when I stepped down to focus full time on Smarterer.  I founded dunnhumby Ventures during my tenure at dunnhumby.

In 2016, I was named one of 30 Most Disruptive People in Boston Tech by Boston Magazine.  In 2009 I was a Finalist (darn) for E&Y Entrepreneur of the year.  In 2008, I was recognized as a Future Legend by the Ad Club. 

In 2007, Harvard University dubbed me one of Boston’s “Hottest Technology CEOs.”  I co‐founded the Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA) in 2004, and authored two books on the subject, Grapevine and The Word of Mouth Manual: Volume II.  My most recent book is The Humility Imperative: Effective Leadership in an Era of Arrogance.

I'm an active investor as a Venture Partner at True Ventures, and have been an active angel investor in firms including Turo, NRG, Presto, Kettle & Fire and HelpScout. In 2011, I co-founded Intelligent.ly (with Sarah Hodges), a classroom space that helps star employees become managers.

Ironically, that only fueled his determination—he became one of the best mathematicians in his region, earning award after award.

With a degree in mechanical and rocket engineering, Ivan spent years building microelectronics, designing custom tools, and mastering precision. Craving a greater challenge, he migrated to the US with no money, no friends, and no knowledge of English.

Landing in Detroit, Michigan, Ivan immersed himself in American culture by living in neighborhoods often considered ""the ghetto,"" where he stood out as the only ""white boy."" Working three jobs and attending school full-time, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in computer science.

Ivan then turned his focus to solving critical software challenges, creating solutions used by hundreds of millions in the banking, lending, and mortgage industries.

Today, Ivan is shaping the future of enterprise tools—tools that enable businesses to streamline processes, maximize ROI, and drive sustainable growth. His mission is to help teams make smarter decisions, achieve optimal trade-offs, and operate with greater efficiency. Ivan’s approach ensures organizations can unlock their full potential, turning challenges into opportunities for success.

Known for designing scalable, bug-free, and cost-effective software solutions, Ivan lays the groundwork for business transformation and growth. He blends technical precision with business acumen, delivering products that go beyond solving today’s problems to anticipate tomorrow’s needs.

Believing that ideas are more powerful than knowledge, Ivan is deeply committed to leveraging automation, AI, and cutting-edge technologies to unlock ROI for businesses of all sizes.

I am engaging and energetic, described by clients as ""makes things happen"" and ""collaborative and impactful."" I balance deep analytical skills with strategic thinking, empathy and curiosity to solve problems and drive change. My approachable communication style enables me to build rapport and credibility with stakeholders quickly.

In 2020 I left corporate life to fulfil my goal of starting my own business and in April I launched Trace along with my friend Joanna.

I started my career in London at a rapidly growing company, where I was part of an entrepreneurial environment and gained experience in product development, experiential marketing and team management. I subsequently moved into strategy consulting, specialising in Financial Services projects predominantly for investment banks.

I relocated to Sydney in 2015 to pursue my career within Macquarie's internal consulting team, where I worked on projects ranging from integrating a newly acquired software company, delivering front to back operational efficiencies in energy trading and facilitating the integration of Macquarie Capital's renewable energy infrastructure assets.

I am passionate about adopting human-centred design to solve problems and identify new opportunities.  At Macquarie, I helped build the Design Thinking and Innovation capability at Macquarie through training delivery and bespoke workshops. 

In 2017 I co-founded 2026 (www.est2026.com.au), a premium fashion brand that designs lifelong, affordable handbags in the fight against fast fashion. Our products are available online but we have put marketing on hold while we focus on Trace.

SecondBrain,Closed,Steven Wilkinson,Critical Thinking Partner for Business Leaders | Visioning Expert - Supporting Owners of Growing Human Scale Businesses  | Investor | Financial Fluency Advocate |,https://ie.linkedin.com/in/stevenknwilkinson,"County Wicklow, Ireland","Working at the interface of finance, strategy and leadership, I partner with owners of human-scale organisations to master growth and create legacy businesses. 

About a decade ago, my wife told me that I was made for advisory work, but I didn’t listen because, after twenty years in finance and investment work, I thought that the only place I should be was on the “buy-side”.

She was right.

Today I love the intimate relationships that advising and supporting leaders of small and not-so-small businesses enables. I lead business owners through my proprietary FutureMapping process to create a Vision of Success for them and their companies and bring clarity to their medium-term intention and aspiration for the future. This transformational process is quite simply the most powerful leadership tool I know of and creates extraordinary energy and focus when it has been completed.

Just over 30 years in finance and investment work, in leadership positions in both private and public companies has gifted me a wealth of insights and experience in all aspects of commercial life and the business of creating value. I have experienced some breathtaking successes and some gut-wrenching, horrible failures and learned more from the latter.

I also love teaching entrepreneurs, business owners and enterprising employees who struggle to find confidence around numbers. I have evolved a program on Financial Fluency that allows them to understand the stories that their numbers are telling them and that builds critical confidence and competence around the language of business.  My Vision is to have shared this program with 1 million students over the next 7 years.

My work takes place at the intersection of business finance, strategy and leadership. I am happiest working with owners of human-scale organisations looking to create legacy businesses. I bring a few decades of “investor perspective” and a well-stocked toolkit and library to every relationship. 

I have been closely associated with the Small Giants Community since before its official founding in May 2009 and some of my best and closest business friendships have their roots in that community. I am also a Mentor in the Ryan Academy/UCD “Mentoring for Growth” program in Dublin, a long time supporter of Ashoka, the worlds leading support network for Social Entrepreneurs in both Germany and Ireland and am a board advisor and participant in the Birthing of Giants Growth Accelerator program based in NYC.",67,,Founder and Managing Director,Good & Prosper Ltd.,Managing Director / Geschäftsführer,Good & Prosper (Deutschland) GmbH,Birthing of Giants Fellowship Program,4 yrs 7 mos,Durham University,,"Rugby School, Warwickshire England",,Leadership Development,Visioning,Business Finance,Business Strategy,Management Consulting,1,,Guest on 'Your Success Is 100% Dependent on You' podcast,,4.0,neutral,,,,,L4,"Based on the available information, Steven Wilkinson appears to be a proven operator with significant executive experience in finance and investment sectors spanning 30+ years.

At 4L we perform outsourced accounting and billing services and provide IT/software solutions, via the cloud, to small and midsize law firms.  4L works with law firms who require the same actionable financial information and the same robust technologies as the very largest firms, but cannot duplicate large firm financial resources for operating expenses and capital investment.

Using cloud-based and desktop virtualization technologies, and a staff with large law firm experience, 4L levels the playing field for small and midsize firms.  Law firms who outsource some, or all, of their back office services are able to save money (as much as 30%-to40%), obtain substantially better financial and IT/software services, and utilize firm leadership time on more profitable pursuits – like client service and attracting new clients.

My skills were honed over nearly 30 years working as COO or CFO in several of the most demanding large law firm environments.  My experience is unique – I was a partner in two law firms, despite never logging billable hours or dealing with clients.  In every firm, my role was always simply defined:  make the lawyers more efficient and more productive and make the firm easier to manage and increasingly more profitable.

But, the business quickly came tumbling down and within a year I lost all our savings and tacked on the balance of the debt to our mortgage, all while I held down my job as a Constable in the NZ Police.

I resumed full-time Policing and joined the Criminal Investigations Branch, aged 21. I left Police after nearly 5 years of service - knowing the only way to make back what I lost was to start again.

And so in 2018 I launched Crosbies Security, fast becoming the market leader in both presence and reputation for mobile surveillance towers in New Zealand. We stopped 85% of all crime and of those who remained, 1/5 were arrested by Police.

In 5 years we took out multiple awards including Best New Product of the Year, Best Emerging Business and Excellence in Innovation. We indexed at 121% growth with the Deloitte Fast50, narrowly missing out on a top 50 placement as one of the fastest growing New Zealand companies.

In mid-2022, in the pursuit of excellence and being disappointed with camera monitoring software available to monitor Crosbies Security cameras, I invented Watchful, taking it to market in New Zealand and Australia in 2023 and launching it in the USA in early 2024.

Centred around our AI decision making persona, Watchful dramatically transformed the way not just Crosbies Security, but many similar businesses and monitoring stations, handled and received camera events - allowing extreme new levels of detail to be processed by monitoring stations and significantly improving the service our clients offered their clients. 

In 2024 I stepped back from the day-to-day running of Crosbies Security and handed it over to Joe Le Fleming Burrow, their General Manager. 

I now focus my time entirely on Watchful, primarily in the USA, allowing central monitoring stations to scale their camera monitoring with precision and accuracy - and to allow them to see what other software failed to do.",34,,Investor,Sence,Founder & CEO,Watchful · Full-time,Founder & Director,Crosbies Security,Royal New Zealand Police College,"Diploma, Police Workplace Practice",,,Management,Police,Security Management,Law Enforcement,Criminal Investigations,3,Shortlisted for Hi-Tech Young Achiever category at NZ Hi-Tech Awards 2024,Featured in interviews and articles discussing AI security innovation,,7.0,positive,,,,Named finalist in NZ Hi-Tech Awards Hi-Tech Young Achiever category; Led Lancaster County reopening in May 2020 defying lockdowns; Led Lancaster County to be #1 in farmland preservation nationally; Oversaw major investments in forest and clean water preservation in Lancaster County; Managed replacement/repair of structurally deficient bridges in Lancaster County; Former Army Infantry Lieutenant with Expert Infantryman’s Badge and Army Parachutist Badge,L4,"Joshua Parsons demonstrates a clear pattern of successful entrepreneurship with multiple ventures and proven operational execution.

Multiple Award-Winning Technologist, CEO and Founder of Story Loom AI, Pioneer in VOIP and OTT Technologies, and International Award-Winning Artist.

For decades, I have been at the forefront of pioneering new technologies, beginning with the creation of the first commercial Voice Over IP service, famously utilized as the ""Star Trek Communicator"". My innovations in telecommunications and media have laid the groundwork for modern technology and entertainment platforms.

I've consulted with NASA on commercializing space and military technologies, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in tech applications. Additionally, I've developed OTT streaming technologies and premium content solutions, collaborating with major industry players like BMI and Warner Brothers.

My contributions to technology and innovation have been recognized in prominent publications such as Wired, Forbes, Fortune, and Fast Company.

I have worked with technology centers, universities, and incubators to accelerate the introduction of innovative technologies to the market. 

I created and hosted ""The Venture Catalyst"" on PBS, a platform that facilitated dialogues between startups and venture capitalists. I am also the author of ""71 Seconds to Funding,"" a guide designed to mentor technology startups on effectively navigating the funding ecosystem.

I am also an artist that is deeply passionate about the intersection of art and technology, and I am drawn to projects that merge the two. My contributions to digital art earned me the 'Illustrators of the Future Award.' My work has also been prominently featured in 'Writers of the Future Volume 37', alongside renowned authors such as Orson Scott Card, Jody Lynn Nye, Craig Elliot, and Kristine Kathryn Rusch.

As Chief Operations Officer at AGI Laboratory Kyrtin has guided, designed, approved, or coordinated nearly all company activities. For purposes of establishing a presence for the company in the EU, he has chosen to relocate to The Hague, Netherlands in preparation for the global commercial deployment of the company’s first major line of products, the “Norn” Global Advisory systems. 

The previous research system was able to solve a business case built from real-world data, provide policy advice across many domains to a small country while citing sources, and ace the hardest version of the UCMRT intelligence test. The new systems being prepared for commercial deployment are heavily updated and upgraded versions of that system, able to scale and operate in real-time. “Demo systems” we are demonstrating now are also fully independent components of the commercial product, machine intelligence cores that showcase fundamental requirements for creating AGI.

Kyrtin is interested in engineering the future, to create a world of greater abundance and ethics than is possible absent real-time scalable collective intelligence and debiasing. He has designed multiple tiers of ethical improvement for such systems, pinpointed numerous engineering opportunities for increasing product value, outlined more than 30 use cases for the technology, and guided company strategy. His knowledge base covers much of computer science, cognitive science, psychology, ethics, and much more.

His opinions are his own, but you'll rarely hear those, as unless the words ""anecdotally"" or ""personally"" are used, options and personal preferences aren't being stated, but rather something that has already been established in the research literature. The exception, of course, is any funny memes being shared.

Kyrtin first read the book ""The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F^&*"" only after multiple colleagues independently told him that they saw the book and opted to inform him that it made them think of him. As he discovered, this was accurate.

His early work focused on network simulation and modeling, where he developed advanced strategies in network and application performance. Fluent in multiple languages, Claudio was instrumental in introducing cutting-edge technologies across Latin America and quickly gained recognition as an industry authority, speaker, and inventor. He has contributed to numerous patents and provided technical due diligence for M&A activities.

Driven by a strong entrepreneurial spirit, Claudio left the corporate sphere to launch a performance consulting firm, which he successfully exited. He then founded and funded a SaaS-based content management platform built on patented technology that peers and industry leaders called “genius” and “visionary.” Within three years, it became the CMS of choice for top global media brands, serving billions of pages monthly. This venture sharpened his expertise in business development, enterprise sales, and executive-level relationship management.

Claudio went on to lead the development of a content discovery and delivery platform and an IP telephony conferencing service, both of which were acquired. He also served as CTO and Board Member at Fuel Ventures, a UK-based seed-stage fund and accelerator, and currently serves as a partner at Multi Venture Capital, focusing on tech investments in the Middle East.

Following his return from EMEA, Claudio co-founded an AI-driven vertical search platform. During the pandemic, he also co-founded a health and wellness company and a real estate development and retail brokerage in Tulum, Mexico.

My proud past always follows me, reminding me of my beginnings when I was hired to establish a company named Proximia for Havas Group. I've been part of the entrepreneurial team in four tech companies, served as the Director of Advertising at Grupo Pascual, a Field Manager at Meta Image, and a Sales Executive at El Corte Inglés.

It's fair to say that I thrive on the challenges I faced yesterday. This began when I was the seventh pick for a human resources department in one of the happiest phases of my career, thanks to my future boss choosing me. Outsiders might see me as fortunate, but as Picasso said, ""luck always found me working hard alongside a great team of colleagues"" in various stages, without whom success would have been impossible.

I believe in leadership that fosters a positive work environment, respecting differences while encouraging commitment and respect. I've been lucky to work with true professional and personal benchmarks. I've also experienced management styles in the past that I'll never replicate. The silver lining is that these experiences have made me a better person and manager than I was yesterday.

Glocally,Active,Miguel Gómez-Aleixandre,Chief Growth Officer at Glocally Group,https://www.linkedin.com/in/miguelgalex/,"Madrid, Community of Madrid, Spain","I’m passionate about Growth Marketing with over 20 years of experience, always driven by one goal: making things grow, whether it’s a team, a project, or an idea. Throughout my career, I’ve led teams and tackled ambitious projects, betting on innovation and digital strategy as the ultimate game-changer.

My journey began as a debate and public speaking coach at CEU San Pablo University, where I turned a group of 5 people into a powerhouse team of over 40, winning national championships along the way. That experience taught me something crucial: effective communication and strong leadership are at the core of any success.

Later, I founded ZINIA, a digital consultancy that started as a small dream and ended up managing major accounts like Nestlé and Philip Morris with a team of 8 amazing professionals. Our commitment to strategic execution led to our acquisition by KREAB, a Swedish multinational.

I had some incredible years at IPG, taking on digital responsibilities across creative and media agencies. Today, I’m leading business growth at Glocally and spearheading the development of LastMile®, a platform that combines data and geo-contextualized campaigns. Collaborating with engineers and mathematicians to create something so innovative and practical has been one of the biggest milestones of my career.

I’m passionate about translating complex technologies into simple, relatable ideas—what I like to think of as my superpower. Right now, my focus is on transforming data into action: using insights from real-world physical behavior to power campaigns with next-level precision.

I draw inspiration from leaders like Simon Sinek, Gary Vaynerchuk, and Nick Vujicic. From them, I’ve learned that passion, authenticity, and persistence can move mountains and reshape entire industries.

- Published one of the first demonstrations of the versatile potential of deep learning methods for the field in 2013 and since then my group developed a number of deep learning approaches to neuroimaging. 
- Developed the theories in complex time series including a number of algorithms creating a new subarea in causal research.

We work with ambitious business owners that have one thing in common: wanting to utilise the digital space to improve their business.

If you’re anything like our clients, you’re an expert in your field. One of the best. 

But you just don’t seem to have the reputation you deserve. 

Here's some more info 👇

We founded Reason8 to help business owners with their websites.

Why? Because websites are the #1 driver of leads and sales for businesses.

Yet, so many businesses have poorly designed, slow, unprofessional websites that turn potential customers away - some don't have a website at all.

We help business owners create a digital presence to generate leads, set them apart and become leaders in their industry.

Our mission is to help enterprising business owners position themselves as the #1 business in their industry and amplify their marketing efforts to fulfil their own mission, generate more business and therefore charge higher prices due to increased demand.

And having built over 100+ websites and online presences, we’ve got quite good at it, achieving results like these in the process: 

🚀 Added 40% to bottom line revenue for a hair salon in Leicester
🚀 Increased bookings by over 200% for a boutique gym in Brighton
🚀 Increased lead generation for a debt advice company by over 400%
🚀 Improved sales by over 25% for a party shop in Leicestershire
🚀 Grew bookings by over 50% for a skin clinic in Nottingham
🚀 Increased sales by 64% for an online furniture retailer
🚀 8x lead generation for a swimming pool installation company in Berkshire
🚀 Increased applications by 45% for a recruitment company in Leicestershire
🚀 Grew lead generation by 125% for an optical practice in Preston
🚀 Helped a Dubai-based luxury estate agency sell over £500m in it's first year
🚀 Took an online retailer of refurbished electricals from £0 to £5k in just 2 months, surpassing Amazon on Google

Really,Closed,Daniel Walton,CMO & UGC Agency Founder | Patient Acquisition Expert | Helping 7-Figure Clinics Get to 8 and 9 Figures | $100M+ in Client Revenue | Meta + TikTok Partner | Medical Marketing Specialist,https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-walton-,"Newport Beach, California, United States","CMO | Digital Marketing Strategist | UGC Agency Founder
Founder of Patient Acquisition, the UGC agency that doesn't just create pretty videos—we create revenue machines. We specialize in high-ticket medical practices and wellness brands that demand results, not excuses. TryEden, Valhalla Vitality, Enhance MD, Morph Wellness, and Drs Rx didn't pay us for participation trophies—they pay us because we've helped our clients generate over $100M in trackable revenue.

What We Actually Do:
UGC Content Creation - 5,000+ videos that generated 30,000+ patient signups last year alone. Medical Marketing - We don't dabble in aesthetic clinics, telehealth, and peptide therapy—we dominate them. 
Content-First Strategy - Educational content that doesn't just ""engage""—it increases LTV and retention because trust converts. 
Omni-Channel Campaigns - TikTok, Meta, Google, YouTube. We go where your money is. Influencer Marketing - 4,000+ real patients generated through creator partnerships, not vanity metrics.

The Numbers Don't Lie:
We helped our clients generate over $100M+ in trackable revenue from paid media and creator campaigns—not inflated ""attribution"" nonsense. Four clinics hit 8-figure run rates in 12 months working with us. Multiple UGC videos generating multi-6-figure revenue each. 33% average LTV improvement across clients—that's money in your pocket. 200% improvement in click-through rates with UGC—the market responds when you speak their language.

Why We Win in Medical Marketing:
As a Meta and TikTok Partner, we don't guess—we know what works. Healthcare marketing has real compliance challenges and demands affluent patients, not tire-kickers. When you combine human psychology with platform optimization, our ads and content speak the language of the AI that pushes our content to your dream customers.

The UGC Difference:
Traditional UGC agencies are content studios masquerading as marketing experts. We're performance marketers first. UGC happens to be one of our most effective tools because platforms algorithmically reward native content with massive reach at fraction of the cost. We don't worship UGC—we weaponize it.

Who We Serve:
Med Spas, Telehealth, Weight Loss and Peptide Clinics, Cosmetic Surgery, High-Ticket B2B. If you can't afford our fees, you can't afford to scale.

How We Think Differently:
Most agencies chase shiny tactics. We build strategic content frameworks that create belief before we ask for the sale. 

Bottom Line:
We help medical practices and wellness brands scale to 7-figure monthly run rates.",37,,CEO | Founder,Patient Acquisition · Self-employed,Founder | CEO,Daniel Walton 365 · Self-employed,Growth Marketing | Founder,droplets,Cerritos College,"Business, Management, and Marketing",Cypress High School,,Team Leadership,Sales Management,Product Development,Marketing,Social Media Marketing,2,,"Freelance reporter covering environment, sustainability, and politics",0,3.0,neutral,,,,,L4,"Daniel Walton demonstrates characteristics of a Proven Operator (L4) based on his successful agency leadership and demonstrated revenue generation for clients.
