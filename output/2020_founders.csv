You can read more about me at bryanmccann.org

Previously, I was a Lead Research Scientist at Salesforce Research. I worked on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. My job was to advance the field of NLP by making difficult new directions seem possible and worthwhile to others. I started an IC but ultimately led my own NLP research team. Throughout I acted as an embedded expert and research manager for production systems (intent, named entity recognition, and voice assistant) and consulted for experimental AI/NLP products.

My deep learning research started with an exploration of transfer learning, which led to contextualized word vectors. Descendants along this line include ELMo and BERT.

Then I turned towards unified text-to-text approaches to multitask learning, culminating in a call to action with the natural language decathlon, which has notable descendants in T5 and GPT-2/3.

Afterwards I branched out into many different directions: explainable NLP, controllable text generation, protein generation with language modeling techniques, and a good deal of summarization as well.

My philosophical research started with questions about meaning, existence, and aesthetics that I studied while pursuing a philosophy degree at Stanford University. My best work in this area at that time was a defense of conceptual analysis that repositioned it as a useful tool for learning rather than as a means of discovering truth.

My foray into deep learning for NLP changed my views on meaning many times over the years, and my philosophical side ventured into the philosophy of science -- a good deal of Popper, Kuhn, and all the rest.

I'm also an avid reader of literature and essays. Italo Calvino is my favorite writer at this moment and has captured what it feels like to think like me more than any other. Proust is second, and a handful of other authors have at various times better represented past versions of myself.

I dabble in poetry and regularly write essays on philosophy, literature, and how they relate to what I learn in research, but so far I only share these pieces by reading aloud.

I read books on Set Theory, Topological Analysis, and other such topics for fun, cover to cover, doing all the exercises. I feel a great appreciation for the beauty of mathematics and especially enjoy mathematical epiphanies in beautiful places -- Set Theory and St. Peter's Basilica's was a match made in heaven.

I also enjoy reading Latin. I never write down translations, but Latin phrases often inspire entire essays and evenings.",27,,Cofounder | CTO,You.com ¬∑ Full-time,Advisor,Moonhub,Advisor,HUMAN CAPITAL,Stanford University,"Master of Science (M.S.), Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)",Stanford University,"Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)",Machine Learning,Data Analysis,Public Speaking,Ruby on Rails,Unix,4,,Guest on YOU + AI podcast discussing AI and NLP; Interview on You.com's vision and AI integration; RAG Brag interview on AI empowering search results; Vision sharing with Richard Socher on founding you.com,,7.0,positive,,,,"Co-founder and CTO of You.com, a company focused on AI and enterprise solutions; Holds over a dozen patents in natural language processing and AI",L3,"Bryan McCann demonstrates strong technical expertise and research leadership experience that places him at the L3 (Technical and Management Veterans) level.

Trenton carries on the family tradition of building and conserving capital by expanding to international markets and ensuring robust strategic planning processes, operations, capital investment programs and internal controls. Trenton hit two ""home runs"" as private equity portfolio company CFO with the sale of US Zinc in 2008 and Duratherm in 2011. Over the past two decades, he completed dozens of M&A transactions, including ""mom & pop"" retail stores, an industrial fabricator, and a magnetic ranging navigation technology suite for drilling.

CFO | INTERIM VP ACCOUNTING

Trenton's capital creation and conservation capabilities were most prominently displayed at Scientific Drilling, where he expanded financial discipline and developed live broadcast internal financial reporting via monthly video calls for worldwide management as revenue, employee count and EBITDA more than doubled during the US land oil shale boom from 2011 to 2014. And at Orion Group Holdings (NYSE: ORN) in 2019, where he assisted a talented, new public company CFO to find agreement with the company's external auditors, improving timeliness and transparency in SEC filings to avert a threatening  activist shareholder situation.

BOARD CHAIR | INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR | AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIR | SENIOR ADVISOR

Trenton recently served on the board of directors of Applied Technologies Associates, Scientific Drilling's R&D and technology manufacturing arm, and chaired the Audit Committee. He guided a matriarch to tax-efficiently fund her legacy project at Adelaida Cellars in Paso Robles, CA. As Board Chair, he built a productive  relationship with the Founder/CEO of ACI Jet in San Luis Obispo, CA. The result was realization of founding shareholder value in a sale to a strategic buyer. As Audit Committee Chair, he led an internal investigation, resulting in en-masse resignation of all of Breitling Energy's Independent Directors. Breitling's CEO was sentenced to 15 years in a federal correctional institution and $92.4 million in restitution, and the CFO, General Counsel, COO and others were sanctioned/disgorged by the SEC. Breitling's previous auditor settled a negligence suit for $7 million. Trenton has proven himself to be a consistent champion of justice in situations of controversy throughout his career.

I have over a decade of experience working to implement inclusive and fair artificial intelligence solutions in lending.

I am the founder of FairPlay, the world‚Äôs first fairness-as-a-service company.  FairPlay automates fair lending testing and reporting and helps lenders run second look programs designed to increase positive outcomes for historically underserved groups. 

Previously, I served as Executive Vice President at Zest.ai, where I led go-to-market strategy for the company‚Äôs AI-powered b2b SaaS underwriting platform and negotiated software licensing, partnership, financing and other commercial deals with Fortune 500 firms, credit bureaus and financial infrastructure providers. I was also a senior member of the team managing Zest‚Äôs $100m installment loan business, which achieved default and customer acquisition rates that were half the industry average.

Prior to Zest.ai, I served as an executive at SoftCard, a mobile payments startup founded by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon that was acquired by Google. While at SoftCard, I negotiated commercial partnerships and software deals with retailers, financial institutions and technology companies like Coca-Cola, American Express and Samsung.

I also served in senior roles in the Obama Administration, first as Chief of Staff to the State Department‚Äôs Special Envoy for Climate Change, where I managed the 50-person team that negotiated the Paris Climate Agreement. I then worked as Senior Advisor to the CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) where I oversaw transaction teams that invested $3.5B in project finance deals across the globe and helped direct the U.S. Government‚Äôs $18B portfolio of emerging market investments.

At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, I served as an economic policy staffer on the Obama-Biden Presidential Campaign. I also served on the Presidential Transition Team, where I helped shape the incoming administration‚Äôs economic crisis response plans for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 

I am a Forbes contributor and a frequent speaker on the application of artificial intelligence to financial services, including consumer loan underwriting, loan servicing, model risk management and fair lending analysis.

From reimagining eligibility verification (EVA) to claims processing (CAM) and payments posting (PHIL) into seamless, efficient operations that healthcare providers can trust.

With Thoughtful, organizations achieve transformative results: 95% faster processing than manual RCM teams, a 75% reduction in claim denials, and a 20% drop in eligibility-related errors. By leveraging advanced technologies like robotic process automation (RPA), natural language processing (NLP), optical character recognition (OCR), and large language models (LLMs), we deliver unmatched speed, accuracy, and reliability to keep revenue cycles running 24/7.

My career began in aerospace and defense, where I built enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems for a global enterprise. Later, I developed RPA bots to enhance ERP operations, sparking the idea for Thoughtful.AI: a platform designed to solve complex challenges of healthcare RCM with cutting-edge technology and AI-powered solutions.

With two decades at the intersection of weather, climate, and technology, my mission is to push the boundaries of innovation and deliver actionable, real-time insights that power smarter decisions for businesses, governments, and communities.

At Climavision, we‚Äôre pioneering the next generation of weather forecasting by fusing advanced proprietary radar networks, satellite technology, AI-driven analytics, and high-resolution modeling. Our solutions provide hyper-local, real-time intelligence that enhances operational resilience and risk mitigation across energy, transportation, insurance, defense, and climate-sensitive industries.

Before launching Climavision, I led global weather technology and data innovation across multiple sectors. As CEO of Enterprise Electronics Corporation (EEC), I oversaw the development and deployment of national remote sensing networks spanning six continents. Prior to that, I spearheaded market and product development strategies at The Weather Channel Companies and AirDat (acquired by Panasonic Avionics), where I helped integrate next-gen atmospheric intelligence into aviation, media, and energy markets.

A certified Air Force Aviation Weather Operations Specialist, I was honored with the Meritorious Service Medal for my contributions to mission-critical meteorology. I hold a BA in Journalism from the University of Montana and have been recognized with two Emmy Awards, including one for technological achievement in designing and engineering a mobile weather radar network for NBC Universal Television Stations Group.

Our manufacturing and farming practices emit tons of carbon emissions that affect the nutrient values of our food every year. We can change these problems with better science and data tools.

I work on solving the greatest problems in food that affect my family, our communities, and the world.

Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege to grow within the best institutions and circles of people far brighter than I ever imagined. As a lifelong movie enthusiast, I've always been drawn to the visual side of technology and its power to captivate and educate‚Äîthis passion ultimately led me to found Colossyan.

Material accomplishments:

- Pioneered the first AI video generator focused on interactive learning, transforming how 2,500+ organizations create engaging content without cameras or complex production.
- Scaled Colossyan to reach over 500,000 users worldwide, empowering Fortune 500 companies like Novartis, UPS, and Ericsson to increase their content production effectiveness and engagement.
- Secured $25M+ in venture funding to advance our mission of turning text into dynamic, interactive videos that aren't just watched but actively experienced.
- Recognized in Forbes 30 Under 30 for Europe's Technology category and named among the Top 50 Generative AI Entrepreneurs of 2025.

Prior to founding Colossyan, I built Defudger, where we created a detection system against visual fake news. My foundation as a software engineer allowed me to build several products that prepared me for the ambitious challenge of reimagining video production through AI.

At Colossyan, we're transforming how businesses engage their employees and customers by creating training, onboarding, and communication content that drives deeper engagement and better results. Our interactive video platform‚Äîfeaturing built-in quizzes, branching scenarios, and multilingual support‚Äîmakes learning and communication more personalized and effective at scale.

I'm committed to nurturing the next generation of founders and currently advise pre-seed and seed-stage startups on fundraising, product development, and sales strategies.

Prior to Rising Team, she led Facebook Groups, used by more than 1.5 billion people each month to create and participate in communities that matter to them. Her team was responsible for envisioning, building and growing the Groups product. She also led the 2019 redesign of Facebook, ‚ÄúFB5,‚Äù to put communities at the center of the app.  

Before Facebook, Dulski was president & COO of Change.org, a social enterprise company that empowers people to create campaigns for change. Under her leadership, Change.org grew 10x, from 18 million users to 180 million, developed a profitable business model, rebuilt its tech stack and supported thousands of successful campaigns globally.

As an early Yahoo! Employee, she held a variety of roles over 9 years there, and ultimately led one of six business units as Group VP & GM of Local and Marketplaces. She left Yahoo! to become co-founder and CEO of The Dealmap, a location-based deals app that Google acquired in 2011, making her the first female entrepreneur to sell a company to Google. She was a product leader at Google for nearly 2 years before joining Change.

She has deep board experience in public and private companies and non-profit boards and currently serves as the Lead Independent Director of Arcadia, a climate tech company. Her previous board experience includes roles on three public company boards, Weight Watchers (NASDAQ: WW), TEGNA (NYSE: TGNA), and Move, Inc. (NASDAQ: MOVE) until its acquisition by NewsCorp.

Dulski writes about leadership for LinkedIn Influencers and Fortune and serves as a lecturer in management at the Stanford Graduate School of Business.

I didn't plan to become a CEO. I studied accounting and sales in college (weird combo, I know), worked at a payments company with category-leading retailers like Ulta and Pottery Barn, then joined Klarna's US launch team when they had zero product-market fit here.

In 2020, I joined Loop when we had just 200 merchants. Today, we work with 5,000+ brands, retaining billions in revenue that would otherwise be lost to returns.

What you should know about me: 

‚Üí I'm still on customer calls every week (can't lead what I don't understand)
‚Üí I believe transparency and authenticity beat hype in the long game 
‚Üí Everything I do comes back to helping merchants run more profitable businesses

I reject most social media because it feels fake. LinkedIn is my one exception because I can have real conversations here about the challenges merchants actually face.

You'll see me talk about:
* Why customer success thinking applies to commerce operations
* How fragile moments drive retention
* Building businesses that actually solve problems vs. chase trends
* What I'm learning from merchants who are figuring out profitability in tough times

That‚Äôs me. At 15, I was an exchange student in Japan. I didn't eat rice. I didn't like fish. I didn't speak Japanese but none of that mattered.  

I got by with basic Japanese and a handy translation dictionary. I managed to absorb the culture, make friends, and explore a world filled with ikebana, udon, Hello Kitty, and Buddhism.

Experiencing this unique and beautiful culture taught me about respect, inclusivity, and gratitude. And I never looked back. 

I‚Äôve spent my life leaping into new opportunities and challenges. From a career in government, politics and policy hoping to make a difference in the world to a national consulting gig working with Fortune 500 companies in every state - except Idaho. Yes, it‚Äôs still on my list. On to The Nature Conservancy where I helped create nearly a billion dollars in conservation funding.
 
Always leveraging a bit of experience and a bit of bravado, I advised elected officials from coast to coast, consulted a winning campaign in Costa Rica, and presented in Thailand at the World Conservation Congress. My network connected me with McKesson Corporation, a pressure cooker of excitement and challenge that schooled me in Fortune 5 culture ‚Äì an experience you just can‚Äôt get anywhere else. 

But an opportunity to go local and run my own shop drew me away to Presence Health where my top-notch team and I tackled some of healthcare‚Äôs thorniest issues. We won awards for advancing telehealth and built a successful campaign that no one in Chicago thought was possible. 

Success, good people and opportunity once again ignited my relentless adventurer and led me to Metopio. It's exciting to lead a company that provides ridiculously easy data tools so you can explore places and learn about the people who live there. 

Challenges make me tick ‚Äì start a company. Check. Create a brand. Check. Curate data. Elevate customer success. Iterate on sales. All part of the day-to-day that helps Metopio empower individuals across organizations and corporations to use data effectively and make data-driven decisions. 

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need a vacation; I need an adventure‚Äù was written on a bag my mom gave me on that trip to Japan. I took that to heart and explored the world.

GrayMatter Robotics,Active,Brual Shah,Co-Founder and CTO @ GrayMatter Robotics,https://www.linkedin.com/in/brual,"Los Angeles, California, United States","I co-founded GrayMatter Robotics with the mission to develop and deploy smart robotic systems by leveraging AI to assist humans in dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks. At GrayMatter Robotics our immediate focus is to develop Smart Assistants for Surface Treatment operations like sanding, polishing, buffing, grinding, deburring, spraying, etc. 

In the past, I have been a robotics researcher for over 9 years working on developing algorithms for realizing operations of robots in our daily life. Since 2012, I have been developing algorithms in the areas of motion and path planning, optimization, and machine learning. Until date, I have published 6 journal articles, 23 conference papers, and 3 patents. 

During my Ph.D., I have developed trajectory and path planners for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) or unmanned boats that enable them to operate in environments of varying sizes and complexities. During my full-time employment at USC,  I expanded my knowledge of decision-making algorithms and started implementing new algorithms for manipulator robots to enable advanced manufacturing applications. The algorithms I have developed are currently being used by robotic finishing (sanding, deburring, polishing, etc.), robotic 3D printing, robotic composite prepreg sheet layup, and assembly.

Apart from academic research, I have been working with industry partners like Lockheed Martin, United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), Boeing, and Indiana Technology and Manufacturing Companies (ITAMCO) in adapting the developed algorithms and testing them on the business cases for robotic finishing, and composite layup applications. These projects are focused on TRL5 -TRL7 level development. 

I was part of the USC team that participated in the KUKA Innovation Award competition in 2017, where our team was one of the top five finalists and the only team from the USA. As a part of this competition, we presented a robotic finishing application in the Hannover Messe trade fair in Germany. I also participated in Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition (ARIAC) organized by NIST in 2017 where our team was ranked first out of 50 teams.

Previously was Co-Founder and CEO of BitWall (acquired). BitWall was one of the first venture-backed Bitcoin startups.

BitWall also was one of the pioneers of social currency, allowing people to pay for content through a Tweet and the subsequent traffic each Tweet sends to a publisher.

By consistently introducing innovative monetization, loyalty, and reward models, BitWall grew a great network of customers and was ultimately acquired by one of the customers it worked most closely with.
Previously founded a mobile wallet and money management platform called Purchace.

Currently, she is the CEO and co-founder of Navi, a youth mental health tech company. Navi is the leader in delivering digital in-the-moment evidence-based supports, based upon a decade of research on Single Session Interventions.  

Julia's first company, BroglieBox, was born out of a personal tragedy‚Äîthe loss of her brother to suicide in 2014. This deeply impactful experience inspired her to become a vocal champion for mental health awareness and support, and prompted her to leave her corporate job as a technical sales executive to embark on entrepreneurship.

BroglieBox curates and sends mental wellness care packages to hundreds of thousands around the globe.  üíå  After the loss of Julia's brother and her own journey with mental health, she was inspired to imagine a new way to deliver support and connection in this fast paced, often impersonal world. BroglieBox is mental wellness, delivered to your doorstep. Boxes & kits are curated with tools and resources for mental health in a way that feels warm, lighthearted, and fun.

As a passionate mental health advocate, Julia has spoken to thousands at schools, companies, and conferences, including the Forbes Under 30 stage.

1. Co-founder of HaikuJAM (2015) - an app where strangers write poems together and feel less alone. Grew the community to 2 million people across Asia, until the company got acquired by India's biggest mental health company in 2020.

2. Founded Patent Drop (2020), a weekly newsletter that summarises new patents from big tech companies. The newsletter organically grew to have a following of 200,000+ people, until it was acquired by The Daily Upside in 2022, a business publication that goes out to 1m people per day.

3. Heading Product at Mayk (2021 onwards), where we are trying to simplify music creation. We've launched a mobile phone studio called mayk.it on the iphone, where we've since created one of the largest music libraries in the world. 

We're now exploring how AI can even further simplify music creation, with two music drops: 

(i) drayk.it - the first text-to-song experience that reached 10m+ people in a few weeks; 

(ii) covers.ai - a tool for people to swap voices on any given song (i.e. ai music covers), a product that has contributed to 10% of the world's music library, within 3 month of release.

‚Ä¢ Enterprise SaaS (VC-backed ~$50M, B-Round)
‚Ä¢ E-Commerce Agency (bootstrapped)
‚Ä¢ Consumer Tech (bootstrapped)

During this journey, I've been fortunate enough to work with some of the most passionate, caring, and driven people in the world. Building businesses and uniting a diverse set of people to accomplish a shared vision and mission is what I love.

My most recent venture was Alyce - www.alyce.com, acquired in February 2024. This enterprise SaaS platform made gifting not just a marketing and sales tool, but also a mindset and approach to creating authentic business relationships. Tens of thousands of marketers and sellers used Alyce to strengthen their most important connections, all while making a positive impact on the world.

Before Alyce, I founded One Pica (now Astound Digital), a global e-commerce agency. I was a part of this company until its acquisition in December 2012. During my time there, I helped build some of the largest commerce and supply chain infrastructures in the world for companies like 3M and Scholastic.

I've also helped grow and facilitate the acquisitions of several retailers, taking them from six-figure revenue to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in just a few years. It's all about execution.

In addition to building businesses, I am passionate about mentoring and advising women and underrepresented founders, especially having a daughter who I want to see have every opportunity I have had.

My #5to9: I'm a fitness enthusiast and peanut butter nut (dad joke). I also love recreational sports -- baseball, softball, and basketball -- but I tend to get a little too competitive and sometimes end up injuring myself.

I'm always on the lookout to participate in the next big opportunity and I'm fascinated by new frontiers in consumer and enterprise products and tech, the applications of generative AI across every industry, and the future of commerce.

USING DATA TO ITERATE - I leverage scorecards and analytics to inform the success of my projects and rely on leading indicators to pivot as needed.
  - Built the performance marketing planning for Ella & Oak and adjusted the marketing mix to achieve a 50% increase in bride sign-ups
  - Designed a funnel scorecard to track our customer journey at aifleet and optimized our process to achieve a 40% increase in efficiency 

BUILDING STRONG TEAMS - I see potential, set high expectations, and coach for success against clear KPIS.
  - Created the aifleet recruiting department to scale truck driver hires to 250+ annually
  - Attracted 30+ volunteers to Comedians at Call to participate in our weekly hotline with 100% retention.

üë®‚Äçüíª I'm a sales rep turned startup founder. 

üá≤üáΩüóΩüçë I spent a year and a half remote working in Mexico. We built most of Lavender during this. I'm based in New York but we got our start in Atlanta. 

üé® üèõ I've been designing software since I was a kid, but went to school to study Government and Economics. 

üåç I'm passionate about entrepreneurship. I wrote my senior thesis on using micro-finance to encourage entrepreneurship and bottoms-up development of emerging economies.

ü¶ä I'm most proud of starting a series of campaigns to help save a historic women's college, Sweet Briar, from closing. 

üë©‚ÄçüéìThe school was saved by its alumnae, and this experience led me to leave my job and start my first startup: an alumni social chat and mobile fundraising app. 

üß† Through that I was introduced to the cognitive sciences, met my co-founders, and pivoted. We built technology for marketers that leveraged personality and decision making science.

üíú COVID happened and we pivoted again, applying our communication psychology research to sales.

As a practicing surgeon, more and more I have watched as the intrusion between the sacred patient-physician relationship has grown. What drives surgeons is the ability to deliver great care to their patients, not the baggage that comes along with- insurance hurdles, administrative bureaucracy, and access to care. 

Tired of the status quo, I teamed up with some smart individuals to create an intelligent surgical scheduling and coordination platform, that cultivates rewarding relationships with each and every patient, allowing surgeons to get back to doing what they enjoy the most- delivering great surgical outcomes.

Healthcare is not immune to innovation, it just acts like it. Our mission at Included Health is to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone. We create the products and culture to power better results for patients everywhere, now and in future. 

How? By making healthcare easier to understand, navigate, and afford. By providing healthcare that‚Äôs EQ + AI, tech-powered and human-driven. It includes everything: acute and chronic, physical and behavioral, in-person and virtual, medical and administrative. 

I‚Äôve always been passionate about product strategy, not just what we‚Äôre building but how we build it. Before IH, I co-founded Reputation.com and grew it into the worldwide leader in online reputation and privacy management. Earlier, I pioneered eBay's unstructured data approach for understanding buyer behavior. My interest in healthcare began even earlier, in Accenture‚Äôs Health and Life Sciences practice. 

This work is complex so the solutions we provide can be simple. So being named one of the World Economic Forum‚Äôs Global Technology Pioneers, one of Goldman Sachs‚Äô Top 50 Builders + Innovators, and Rock Health‚Äôs Most Beloved CEOs matters to me. It‚Äôs a direct reflection of the hard work and success of those around me, from engineers to clinicians, care team to admins. 

We're looking forward. Future healthcare will be powered by data, so clinicians know instantly who you are and how you want to be taken care of. It will make possible both digital and in-person experiences, at the right time, for speed, ease, and accuracy. It‚Äôll be connective, including more people and providers. And it‚Äôll be contextual, understanding your job, language, spiritual practice, and cultural identity all matter to your health.

Ever since I am on a journey to explore, shape and create impact which I will be proud to look back on, on my own death bed.

With an insatiable curiosity for human behavior, ADHD and the mission to understand what it means to make a ‚Äì my ‚Äì life worthwhile, it wasn't always easy, as you can imagine. 

Now, with over a decade of fascination, study and experience in the field, I can say, I found my dharma (ikigai) ‚Äì I support people in finding Meaning in their lives. 

Specifically, I work with high-impact leaders, founders, and entrepreneurs who have built success on the outside, but are asking the deeper questions on the inside: ""Is this it?"" and ""What's the next chapter of my life?""

How do I help answer those questions? With holistic approaches in three domains:

1. Through my company, Kinisi. As Founder & CEO, I lead a team of expert therapists who facilitate our boutique, legal psychedelic journeys in the Netherlands. While psychedelics are not the panacea for getting a ""better life"", they are unparalleled tools to gain clarity, momentum and reconnect to oneself. If you're interested in personal development, biohacking and healing, you should definitely be looking at psychedelics as the next-gen performance tool. If you want to be ahead of the curve, come talk to me ;-)

2. As a healing practitioner (in training) I coach individuals by creating individualised habit protocols that seamlessly integrate in their every day busy lives. With over a decade of experiences and trainings in various domains and my superpower (feeling) up my toolbelt, alchemising just what the individual needs comes very natural to me. And brings me endless joy.

3. My creative outlet has been writing for a while and I recently started sharing my learnings and ideas on Substack: @sophiesharper ‚Äì follow me for some entertainment education! 

Across all these domains, my mission is the same: to provide the tools and containers for leaders to do the deep inner work that unlocks their next level of purpose and performance.

Unlike wobbly bipeds, our bots are smart, speedy, scalable, and safe to work alongside humans so we can solve today's labor shortages. I've shipped over 25,000 robots at my previous startups, and my co-founder Ed Lando has founded unicorn startups that have raised hundreds of millions.

I've spent the last 15 years founding robotics startups because I hate inefficiency. I turned my childhood bedroom into a robotics lab and started the UK's first robot fighting league while working in warehouses and factories. But after a job made me unscrew 1000 screws manually, I knew my mission was to build practical bots that take hard labor off of people's shoulders. 

I spent a decade in academia, researching humanoid locomotion for my PhD, before founding Bear Robotics. Funded with $180M by investors like SoftBank, we built waiter bots that delivered millions of meals to tables. But without AI, they had to be hard-coded for each restaurant and struggled when tables were rearranged. So I spent two years advising top robotics startups while learning to design LLM-powered hardware before recruiting a team from Nvidia and Dyson.

She has supported FDA Biologics License Applications by advancing Quality by Design initiatives in Process Development, Manufacturing Sciences and Technology, and Commercial Manufacturing operations.  She has also applied machine learning and artificial intelligence for multivariate modeling to optimize pharmaceutical production and perform root cause analysis, most recently at Bayer Pharmaceuticals.  Her education consists of a 5-year accelerated bachelors and masters program in chemical engineering at the University of Rochester, NY, and she was most recently pursuing a PhD in applied AI with wearables research for Parkinson‚Äôs patients at the University of Luxembourg.  

During her time supporting various technical initiatives in pharma, she became very familiar with the challenges the sector faces to maintain product quality.  It was in this capacity that she recognized the significant potential for AI in process development and commercial drug manufacturing.  So Chartier started the AI software company, Modicus Prime, to provide pharma with the right AI computational techniques and apply them in a vigorous way to help safely and more efficiently produce drugs for patients.  Modicus Prime‚Äôs computer vision software automates biologics image analysis and is designed to solve for the cost, legal, and waste liabilities from product quality failures across R&D and manufacturing.

AI FOR PET,Active,Ryan Gruzen,Founder Building Trustworthy AI for Pet Health | We Save Pets' Lives,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-gruzen,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Building technology that enhances the most important relationships in life.

Two years ago, I made a decision that surprised everyone, including myself. After 20 years building a successful video production career, I walked away to solve a problem that affects 70% of American households: what to do when your pet needs help and you don't know if it's an emergency.

The catalyst? A terrifying night with my Shih-Tzu Cooper that exposed a massive gap in pet healthcare accessibility. Between unreliable Facebook groups and $5,000 emergency vet bills, pet parents are left guessing when their companions need help most.

So I built Pet Portal AI and our Pet Health Advisor. Our specialized AI provides instant, trustworthy pet health guidance without the hallucinations that make generic AI dangerous for medical advice. We've engineered Constitutional AI principles into every response, ensuring accuracy comes first, always.

What makes this different? We're not replacing veterinarians, we're enhancing their ability to serve more families by handling the flood of ""is this an emergency?"" questions that overwhelm the system. Dr. Marty Becker called it a game-changer for addressing the service desert in pet care.

The validation has been incredible. Pet parents finally have trusted guidance in those critical moments. And when Cooper's eye required removal this year, our own system helped me navigate that heartbreaking decision. The ultimate test of technology built with love.

This isn't just a career pivot. It's a movement toward technology that actually enhances human capability rather than replacing it. Every interaction we design serves one purpose: helping pets and people live happier, healthier lives together.

Currently serving thousands of pet parents through our free beta. Because every 3 AM worry deserves a trustworthy answer.",47,,Founder,Pet Portal AI ¬∑ Full-time,President/Director,Maximilian Productions Inc.,Generative AI Account Lead,Thinkable ¬∑ Contract,"University of California, Santa Cruz","Film and Digital Media, Film and Digital Media",Santa Monica High School,,Pet Tech,Post Production,Commercials,Start-up Leadership,Content Development,2,,The 3 Ps of AI-Driven Veterinary Care webinar,0,6.0,positive,,,,,L2,"Ryan Gruzen appears to be an early-stage entrepreneur who has made a significant career pivot from video production to founding an AI-focused pet health startup.

I'm obsessed with team performance in all of its forms, including corporate settings, sports, and even the arts. With a 25-year career as a tech founder and executive in Silicon Valley, experience at the largest companies (Google) and startups alike, publishing academic papers and being awarded more than a dozen patents in machine learning, I've seen teams perform across countless contexts. And nothing is transforming CX team performance in the enterprise like the newest breakthroughs in AI and machine learning.

Previously, I was the Founder/CTO at Wavefront (also backed by Sequoia Capital, and acquired by VMware for 9 figures). I was also early at PayPal (pre-eBay acquisition in 2002) and Google (2006) as a software engineer, and was a Founding Engineer at GLMX, the leading electronic exchange for the money markets (over $600B in daily transaction volume).

I've published multiple papers in computational biology and medical information at Stanford Medical School, and have over a dozen patents in machine learning and AI. My popular writing on machine learning has been cited in academic papers and classes at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Seoul National University, and even a PhD thesis. I wrote a widely-read article on Generative AI back in 2017.

Not only have we reduced time to market for businesses from 2 weeks to under 1 day, but have also enabled small merchants to get easy access to high quality images.

Prior to Dresma, I ran an off-shore post production services business which gave me a deep understanding of the issues faced in the content creation process by both small & large businesses .

This magic combination of speed, quality, and cost represents my favorite puzzle to help companies and innovators solve.

As an innovator in the business enterprise, I quickly learned the value of investments in innovation and balancing that priority with in-market, revenue-generating products. As a developer, I grew to understand how technology can become the focus of a business and possibly overshadow core competencies that a company delivers to the market and the people who are the idea generators.

Our technology, HarmCheck, can be used to protect companies from the cost and toll of litigation stemming from harmful communication, while serving as an always-on communication guide for individuals and teams. We detect over 40 categories of harm, from workplace discrimination, threats, bullying, retaliation, and harassment to industry-specific verticals, including financial services. We proactively surface unfair lending, document tampering, covert communication, and more.  We're the safety net that companies and individuals need. The world has spell check and grammar check. We are HarmCheck.

My background is in journalism and storytelling. I spent 20+ years as a journalist at the San Francisco Chronicle. I had my stories nominated multiple times for the Pulitzer Prize. I went on to write five nonfiction books, including Alpha Girls, which was about a group of trailblazing women who helped fund and build some of the world's most important companies. The book is being adapted for a television series by Academy Award-winning producer Cathy Schulman. 

I've written other books about big dreams, jaw-dropping technology, and game-changing people. My book, ""How to Make a Spaceship: A Band of Renegades, an Epic Race, and the Birth of Private Spaceflight,"" has a foreword by Richard Branson and an afterword by the late Prof. Stephen Hawking. It tells the back story to the thriving private race to space we have today with Peter Diamandis, Elon Musk, Richard Branson, Jeff Bezos, and others. 

I spent a year interviewing Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, for my book, ""The Billionaire and The Mechanic."" This story, like the others I gravitate to, is about those underdogs who dare to go after what others say is impossible. They are relentless in their pursuits and brilliant in their often risky solutions. They don't succeed alone.

All of my training as a storyteller serves me well as a founder and CEO. Stories have the power to open doors and minds and jumpstart industries. Through the right stories, companies can better recruit, retain, and advance their employees. 

At Alphy, we've built a novel technology platform that is simply more advanced at detecting harm in communication than any compliance solution on the market.

SparkAI,Active,Jacob Gephart,Founder | SparkAI Consulting,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobgephart28,"Cherry Hill, New Jersey, United States","As the founder of multiple ventures, my career in business began in the pet industry, where I launched and successfully sold two companies: Portfolio Pet and Worthy Wags. These ventures‚Äîranging from custom pet portraits to curated wellness subscription boxes‚Äîgave me hands-on experience in operations, digital marketing, customer experience, and financial management.

I later joined SocialLadder as an Account Executive, where I helped the platform enter the subscription box market through strategic micro-influencer partnerships. That role sharpened my skills in partnership development and brand growth strategy. Following that, I served as a Financial Services Professional at Evolution Financial Group, deepening my understanding of financial planning, long-term business viability, and client consulting.

Through these diverse roles, I realized that no matter the industry‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs pets, finance, or tech‚Äîthe businesses that grow sustainably are the ones that understand their operations deeply and apply smart systems to scale them efficiently.

That insight led me to launch SparkAI Consulting.

Like many, I was captivated by AI‚Äôs potential‚Äîbut also disillusioned by the flood of tools that overpromise, confuse, and often fail to deliver for real-world service businesses. AI has been marketed with tech jargon, overhyped chatbots, and platforms that leave business owners feeling overwhelmed, not empowered.

At SparkAI Consulting, we do things differently. We don‚Äôt sell one-size-fits-all software. We partner directly with HVAC companies and other service businesses to:
Understand their workflow and pain points

Recommend and integrate tailored AI tools

Train their teams and provide ongoing support
