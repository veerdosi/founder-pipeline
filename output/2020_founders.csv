You can read more about me at bryanmccann.org

Previously, I was a Lead Research Scientist at Salesforce Research. I worked on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing. My job was to advance the field of NLP by making difficult new directions seem possible and worthwhile to others. I started an IC but ultimately led my own NLP research team. Throughout I acted as an embedded expert and research manager for production systems (intent, named entity recognition, and voice assistant) and consulted for experimental AI/NLP products.

My deep learning research started with an exploration of transfer learning, which led to contextualized word vectors. Descendants along this line include ELMo and BERT.

Then I turned towards unified text-to-text approaches to multitask learning, culminating in a call to action with the natural language decathlon, which has notable descendants in T5 and GPT-2/3.

Afterwards I branched out into many different directions: explainable NLP, controllable text generation, protein generation with language modeling techniques, and a good deal of summarization as well.

My philosophical research started with questions about meaning, existence, and aesthetics that I studied while pursuing a philosophy degree at Stanford University. My best work in this area at that time was a defense of conceptual analysis that repositioned it as a useful tool for learning rather than as a means of discovering truth.

My foray into deep learning for NLP changed my views on meaning many times over the years, and my philosophical side ventured into the philosophy of science -- a good deal of Popper, Kuhn, and all the rest.

I'm also an avid reader of literature and essays. Italo Calvino is my favorite writer at this moment and has captured what it feels like to think like me more than any other. Proust is second, and a handful of other authors have at various times better represented past versions of myself.

I dabble in poetry and regularly write essays on philosophy, literature, and how they relate to what I learn in research, but so far I only share these pieces by reading aloud.

I read books on Set Theory, Topological Analysis, and other such topics for fun, cover to cover, doing all the exercises. I feel a great appreciation for the beauty of mathematics and especially enjoy mathematical epiphanies in beautiful places -- Set Theory and St. Peter's Basilica's was a match made in heaven.

I also enjoy reading Latin. I never write down translations, but Latin phrases often inspire entire essays and evenings.",27,,Cofounder | CTO,You.com · Full-time,Advisor,Moonhub,Advisor,HUMAN CAPITAL,Stanford University,"Master of Science (M.S.), Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)",Stanford University,"Bachelor of Science (B.S.), Computer Science (Artificial Intelligence)",Machine Learning,Data Analysis,Public Speaking,Ruby on Rails,Unix,4,,Guest on YOU + AI podcast discussing AI and NLP; Interview on You.com's vision and AI integration; RAG Brag interview on AI empowering search results; Vision sharing with Richard Socher on founding you.com,,7.0,positive,,,,"Co-founder and CTO of You.com, a company focused on AI and enterprise solutions; Holds over a dozen patents in natural language processing and AI",L3,"Bryan McCann demonstrates strong technical expertise and research leadership experience that places him at the L3 (Technical and Management Veterans) level.

The problem is that you can’t please everybody: whether you’re giving your teams private medical, gym memberships, mental health support, or financial advice, there will always be gaps.

That’s why my wife, @ Steph Hind, and I founded Heka; the only employee benefit to focus on individual health, Heka powers productive companies.

When people live at their best they perform at their best, too - driving company success. Stop wasting money on benefits that don’t land, and give your people the power to be their best selves, every day. Heka gives your team limitless options to improve their health and make better choices, whatever that looks like for them.

Life is unpredictable; with Heka, we’ve watched our own team thrive. From free financial advice buying their first home, to growing their family through fertility support.

Trenton carries on the family tradition of building and conserving capital by expanding to international markets and ensuring robust strategic planning processes, operations, capital investment programs and internal controls. Trenton hit two ""home runs"" as private equity portfolio company CFO with the sale of US Zinc in 2008 and Duratherm in 2011. Over the past two decades, he completed dozens of M&A transactions, including ""mom & pop"" retail stores, an industrial fabricator, and a magnetic ranging navigation technology suite for drilling.

CFO | INTERIM VP ACCOUNTING

Trenton's capital creation and conservation capabilities were most prominently displayed at Scientific Drilling, where he expanded financial discipline and developed live broadcast internal financial reporting via monthly video calls for worldwide management as revenue, employee count and EBITDA more than doubled during the US land oil shale boom from 2011 to 2014. And at Orion Group Holdings (NYSE: ORN) in 2019, where he assisted a talented, new public company CFO to find agreement with the company's external auditors, improving timeliness and transparency in SEC filings to avert a threatening  activist shareholder situation.

BOARD CHAIR | INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR | AUDIT COMMITTEE CHAIR | SENIOR ADVISOR

Trenton recently served on the board of directors of Applied Technologies Associates, Scientific Drilling's R&D and technology manufacturing arm, and chaired the Audit Committee. He guided a matriarch to tax-efficiently fund her legacy project at Adelaida Cellars in Paso Robles, CA. As Board Chair, he built a productive  relationship with the Founder/CEO of ACI Jet in San Luis Obispo, CA. The result was realization of founding shareholder value in a sale to a strategic buyer. As Audit Committee Chair, he led an internal investigation, resulting in en-masse resignation of all of Breitling Energy's Independent Directors. Breitling's CEO was sentenced to 15 years in a federal correctional institution and $92.4 million in restitution, and the CFO, General Counsel, COO and others were sanctioned/disgorged by the SEC. Breitling's previous auditor settled a negligence suit for $7 million. Trenton has proven himself to be a consistent champion of justice in situations of controversy throughout his career.

I was also a senior member of the team managing Zest’s $100m installment loan business, which achieved default and customer acquisition rates that were half the industry average.

Prior to Zest.ai, I served as an executive at SoftCard, a mobile payments startup founded by AT&T, T-Mobile and Verizon that was acquired by Google. While at SoftCard, I negotiated commercial partnerships and software deals with retailers, financial institutions and technology companies like Coca-Cola, American Express and Samsung.

I also served in senior roles in the Obama Administration, first as Chief of Staff to the State Department’s Special Envoy for Climate Change, where I managed the 50-person team that negotiated the Paris Climate Agreement. I then worked as Senior Advisor to the CEO of the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) where I oversaw transaction teams that invested $3.5B in project finance deals across the globe and helped direct the U.S. Government’s $18B portfolio of emerging market investments.

At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, I served as an economic policy staffer on the Obama-Biden Presidential Campaign. I also served on the Presidential Transition Team, where I helped shape the incoming administration’s economic crisis response plans for the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. 

I am a Forbes contributor and a frequent speaker on the application of artificial intelligence to financial services, including consumer loan underwriting, loan servicing, model risk management and fair lending analysis.

Now, she’s bringing that same clarity and accountability to food. Her mission: make it easy for people and institutions to understand what’s actually in our food—and how it affects our health.

Frustrated by misleading labels and wellness marketing, Sam brought a team together to create the FoodHealth Score: a 1–100 rating that demystifies food health using real nutrition science, not fads or hype. It’s now used by retailers, food brands, and data providers to drive smarter decisions at every level of the food system.

Under her leadership, FoodHealth Company has partnered with industry giants like NielsenIQ, Kroger, and Hy-Vee to embed health scoring into shopping data, retail experiences, and food benefit programs. Together, they’re making it possible to measure the nutritional quality of everything in your cart—and compare trends across demographics, regions, and payment types.

Sam has been featured in Forbes and Inc, and is a frequent speaker at HLTH, Food-as-Medicine Summits and national policy forums where she challenges brands and institutions to move from spin to substance—and make food health as transparent as calorie counts.

With two decades at the intersection of weather, climate, and technology, my mission is to push the boundaries of innovation and deliver actionable, real-time insights that power smarter decisions for businesses, governments, and communities.

At Climavision, we’re pioneering the next generation of weather forecasting by fusing advanced proprietary radar networks, satellite technology, AI-driven analytics, and high-resolution modeling. Our solutions provide hyper-local, real-time intelligence that enhances operational resilience and risk mitigation across energy, transportation, insurance, defense, and climate-sensitive industries.

Before launching Climavision, I led global weather technology and data innovation across multiple sectors. As CEO of Enterprise Electronics Corporation (EEC), I oversaw the development and deployment of national remote sensing networks spanning six continents. Prior to that, I spearheaded market and product development strategies at The Weather Channel Companies and AirDat (acquired by Panasonic Avionics), where I helped integrate next-gen atmospheric intelligence into aviation, media, and energy markets.

A certified Air Force Aviation Weather Operations Specialist, I was honored with the Meritorious Service Medal for my contributions to mission-critical meteorology. I hold a BA in Journalism from the University of Montana and have been recognized with two Emmy Awards, including one for technological achievement in designing and engineering a mobile weather radar network for NBC Universal Television Stations Group.

For over 25 years, I've pioneered merging big data with meteorology and remote sensing – a lifelong passion culminating in the launch of Climavision – a gamechanger in ClimateTech.

My portfolio of success comes from my ability to build lasting relationships and keep an eye toward future market potential. After decades in weather tech, I know intimately both the value and the limitations of global observation and data networks. Climavision addresses this exact problem, expanding access to high integrity weather information and filling blind spots in current global observation networks. Through strategic partnerships and a $100m strategic investment from TPG’s The Rise Fund, our team is alleviating the burden of expensive weather infrastructure and rolling out a proprietary network of radio-occultation satellite and ground-based sensors to help mitigate the risks of increasingly volatile weather.

I spend most of my time working on Journey Foods and creative projects that excite me deeply: my book and animation. 

I don't do all at once, but I weave in FOOD in most of my endeavors since a young age; gardening with my grandmother and fishing with my grandad. In the food system, there is a lot of work to be done so one must diversify both inspiration and endeavors to continue to harvest change. 

I share my perspective on all things food and culture weekly. Join my newsletter of over 12,000 subscribers here: https://mailchi.mp/journeyfoods/saturday-pie-subscribe

I love working on the growth challenges in government, non-profits, Fortune 500 companies and new, fast growing startup ecosystems. 

Consumers spend $3 Trillion a year on packaged foods. At the same time, there’s undeniable evidence that eating packaged foods is related to the increase in chronic diseases - cancer, diabetes, and poor mental health. Our manufacturing and farming practices emit tons of carbon emissions that affect the nutrient values of our food every year. We can change these problems with better science and data tools.

I work on solving the greatest problems in food that affect my family, our communities, and the world.

Throughout my journey, I've had the privilege to grow within the best institutions and circles of people far brighter than I ever imagined. As a lifelong movie enthusiast, I've always been drawn to the visual side of technology and its power to captivate and educate—this passion ultimately led me to found Colossyan.

Material accomplishments:

- Pioneered the first AI video generator focused on interactive learning, transforming how 2,500+ organizations create engaging content without cameras or complex production.
- Scaled Colossyan to reach over 500,000 users worldwide, empowering Fortune 500 companies like Novartis, UPS, and Ericsson to increase their content production effectiveness and engagement.
- Secured $25M+ in venture funding to advance our mission of turning text into dynamic, interactive videos that aren't just watched but actively experienced.
- Recognized in Forbes 30 Under 30 for Europe's Technology category and named among the Top 50 Generative AI Entrepreneurs of 2025.

Prior to founding Colossyan, I built Defudger, where we created a detection system against visual fake news. My foundation as a software engineer allowed me to build several products that prepared me for the ambitious challenge of reimagining video production through AI.

At Colossyan, we're transforming how businesses engage their employees and customers by creating training, onboarding, and communication content that drives deeper engagement and better results. Our interactive video platform—featuring built-in quizzes, branching scenarios, and multilingual support—makes learning and communication more personalized and effective at scale.

I'm committed to nurturing the next generation of founders and currently advise pre-seed and seed-stage startups on fundraising, product development, and sales strategies.

But at my core, I’m a nine-year-old with a healthy disregard for the impossible, always pursuing my boldest dreams. 

As a young boy, I was captivated by the Apollo 11 Moon landing—an event that sparked my dream to explore the final frontier and bring humanity with me. 

Growing up in a family of Greek immigrants, I was expected to follow my father into medicine. I earned my M.D. from Harvard and degrees in Molecular Genetics and Aerospace Engineering at MIT, and thought NASA was my path to space. I quickly realized it wasn’t and turned to entrepreneurship to transform science fiction into reality.

Now, I’ve co-founded and invested in companies across space, longevity, AI, education, and more, all with a core mission to drive humanity forward using exponential technologies. 

My work has been recognized globally, including being named one of Fortune’s “World’s 50 Greatest Leaders.” My New York Times bestsellers, include Abundance, Bold, The Future is Faster Than You Think, and Life Force.

A few of my most notable ventures include:

- XPRIZE Foundation: Uses large-scale incentive competitions to solve the world's biggest challenges. We’ve launched $600M of prizes (30 over 30 years) to spark breakthroughs across industries

- Celularity: A cellular therapy company focused on extending the healthy human lifespan

- Fountain Life: A company providing advanced diagnostics and therapeutics to extend longevity by detecting diseases early and enhancing overall wellness

- Singularity University: A Silicon Valley institution studying exponential technologies and their ability to transform industries and solve humanity’s grand challenges

- BOLD Capital Partners (BOLD) & Exponential Ventures (XPV): BOLD is my venture fund focused on biotech and longevity, and XPV focus on incubating AI Startups

- Abundance360 (A360): A year-round program for entrepreneurs, investors, and executives focused on leveraging exponential technologies—like AI, robotics and biotech—to drive positive change and leave a legacy

At Abundance360 “we believe the best way to predict the future is to create it yourself.” We also believe that “the world’s biggest problems, are the world’s biggest business opportunities”. My A360 community thinks boldly, innovates fearlessly, and tackles the world’s greatest challenges.

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.

I didn't plan to become a CEO. I studied accounting and sales in college (weird combo, I know), worked at a payments company with category-leading retailers like Ulta and Pottery Barn, then joined Klarna's US launch team when they had zero product-market fit here.

In 2020, I joined Loop when we had just 200 merchants. Today, we work with 5,000+ brands, retaining billions in revenue that would otherwise be lost to returns.

What you should know about me: 

→ I'm still on customer calls every week (can't lead what I don't understand)
→ I believe transparency and authenticity beat hype in the long game 
→ Everything I do comes back to helping merchants run more profitable businesses

I reject most social media because it feels fake. LinkedIn is my one exception because I can have real conversations here about the challenges merchants actually face.

You'll see me talk about:
* Why customer success thinking applies to commerce operations
* How fragile moments drive retention
* Building businesses that actually solve problems vs. chase trends
* What I'm learning from merchants who are figuring out profitability in tough times

That’s me. At 15, I was an exchange student in Japan. I didn't eat rice. I didn't like fish. I didn't speak Japanese but none of that mattered.  

I got by with basic Japanese and a handy translation dictionary. I managed to absorb the culture, make friends, and explore a world filled with ikebana, udon, Hello Kitty, and Buddhism.

Experiencing this unique and beautiful culture taught me about respect, inclusivity, and gratitude. And I never looked back. 

I’ve spent my life leaping into new opportunities and challenges. From a career in government, politics and policy hoping to make a difference in the world to a national consulting gig working with Fortune 500 companies in every state - except Idaho. Yes, it’s still on my list. On to The Nature Conservancy where I helped create nearly a billion dollars in conservation funding.
 
Always leveraging a bit of experience and a bit of bravado, I advised elected officials from coast to coast, consulted a winning campaign in Costa Rica, and presented in Thailand at the World Conservation Congress. My network connected me with McKesson Corporation, a pressure cooker of excitement and challenge that schooled me in Fortune 5 culture – an experience you just can’t get anywhere else. 

But an opportunity to go local and run my own shop drew me away to Presence Health where my top-notch team and I tackled some of healthcare’s thorniest issues. We won awards for advancing telehealth and built a successful campaign that no one in Chicago thought was possible. 

Success, good people and opportunity once again ignited my relentless adventurer and led me to Metopio. It's exciting to lead a company that provides ridiculously easy data tools so you can explore places and learn about the people who live there. 

Challenges make me tick – start a company. Check. Create a brand. Check. Curate data. Elevate customer success. Iterate on sales. All part of the day-to-day that helps Metopio empower individuals across organizations and corporations to use data effectively and make data-driven decisions. 

“I don’t need a vacation; I need an adventure” was written on a bag my mom gave me on that trip to Japan. I took that to heart and explored the world. 

At Metopio, we give you the confidence to explore data and create insights and tell the story you want to tell. No coding and no data science training required.

Inspired by the burgeoning field of optogenetics, the team then set out to commercially harness light — an abundant, safe, and versatile input — to control cellular behavior with unparalleled precision and optimize this over time using AI.

Deniz cultivated expertise in biological systems through academic research and professional innovation. Deniz earned his PhD in the Centre for Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine at King's College London, where he co-discovered a new human liver stem cell population and conducted the world’s first high throughput small molecule screen using IPS-derived hepatocytes. Prior to his PhD, Deniz had worked in a cancer immunotherapy lab at the University of Bristol and worked on a single-dose cure for Asthma at GlaxoSmithKline. Deniz also received his Master’s degree in biomedical and translational science from King’s College London, and his Bachelor’s degree in Cellular and Molecular Medicine from the University of Bristol.

GrayMatter Robotics,Active,Brual Shah,Co-Founder and CTO @ GrayMatter Robotics,https://www.linkedin.com/in/brual,"Los Angeles, California, United States","I co-founded GrayMatter Robotics with the mission to develop and deploy smart robotic systems by leveraging AI to assist humans in dull, dirty, and dangerous tasks. At GrayMatter Robotics our immediate focus is to develop Smart Assistants for Surface Treatment operations like sanding, polishing, buffing, grinding, deburring, spraying, etc. 

In the past, I have been a robotics researcher for over 9 years working on developing algorithms for realizing operations of robots in our daily life. Since 2012, I have been developing algorithms in the areas of motion and path planning, optimization, and machine learning. Until date, I have published 6 journal articles, 23 conference papers, and 3 patents. 

During my Ph.D., I have developed trajectory and path planners for unmanned surface vehicles (USVs) or unmanned boats that enable them to operate in environments of varying sizes and complexities. During my full-time employment at USC,  I expanded my knowledge of decision-making algorithms and started implementing new algorithms for manipulator robots to enable advanced manufacturing applications. The algorithms I have developed are currently being used by robotic finishing (sanding, deburring, polishing, etc.), robotic 3D printing, robotic composite prepreg sheet layup, and assembly.

Apart from academic research, I have been working with industry partners like Lockheed Martin, United Technologies Research Center (UTRC), Boeing, and Indiana Technology and Manufacturing Companies (ITAMCO) in adapting the developed algorithms and testing them on the business cases for robotic finishing, and composite layup applications. These projects are focused on TRL5 -TRL7 level development. 

I was part of the USC team that participated in the KUKA Innovation Award competition in 2017, where our team was one of the top five finalists and the only team from the USA. As a part of this competition, we presented a robotic finishing application in the Hannover Messe trade fair in Germany. I also participated in Agile Robotics for Industrial Automation Competition (ARIAC) organized by NIST in 2017 where our team was ranked first out of 50 teams. In this competition, we developed a kitting algorithm to efficiently assemble kits after the order is received and deliver them upon completion.",32,,Co-Founder and CTO,GrayMatter Robotics · Full-time,Research Scientist,University of Southern California,Postdoctoral Research Associate,USC Viterbi School of Engineering,University of Maryland - A.

Currently, she is the CEO and co-founder of Navi, a youth mental health tech company. Navi is the leader in delivering digital in-the-moment evidence-based supports, based upon a decade of research on Single Session Interventions.  

Julia's first company, BroglieBox, was born out of a personal tragedy—the loss of her brother to suicide in 2014. This deeply impactful experience inspired her to become a vocal champion for mental health awareness and support, and prompted her to leave her corporate job as a technical sales executive to embark on entrepreneurship.

BroglieBox curates and sends mental wellness care packages to hundreds of thousands around the globe.  💌  After the loss of Julia's brother and her own journey with mental health, she was inspired to imagine a new way to deliver support and connection in this fast paced, often impersonal world. BroglieBox is mental wellness, delivered to your doorstep. Boxes & kits are curated with tools and resources for mental health in a way that feels warm, lighthearted, and fun.

As a passionate mental health advocate, Julia has spoken to thousands at schools, companies, and conferences, including the Forbes Under 30 stage. She is the recipient of the BMO Harris ""Women Who Inspire"" award. Her work has been featured in Forbes, goop, Thrive Global, NBC, CBS, On Air with Ryan Seacrest, Maria Shriver's Sunday Paper, The Mighty, and more publications.

We're building AI-native tools for artists, marketers, and fans to generate remix content across TikTok and short-form media.

Before MAYK, I led global marketing as 1st CMO at Cameo and TikTok (US/Global launch), and launched YouTube Premium at Google—working across product launches, building growth playbooks, and creator/content operations. Across all roles, I’ve focused on turning creative platforms into repeatable, operationally sound systems—where community/content, product/growth, and partner/ops execution converge to drive breakout growth.

I like to build tech products that impact culture:

1. Co-founder of HaikuJAM (2015) - an app where strangers write poems together and feel less alone. Grew the community to 2 million people across Asia, until the company got acquired by India's biggest mental health company in 2020.

2. Founded Patent Drop (2020), a weekly newsletter that summarises new patents from big tech companies. The newsletter organically grew to have a following of 200,000+ people, until it was acquired by The Daily Upside in 2022, a business publication that goes out to 1m people per day.

3. Heading Product at Mayk (2021 onwards), where we are trying to simplify music creation. We've launched a mobile phone studio called mayk.it on the iphone, where we've since created one of the largest music libraries in the world. 

We're now exploring how AI can even further simplify music creation, with two music drops: 

(i) drayk.it - the first text-to-song experience that reached 10m+ people in a few weeks; 

(ii) covers.ai - a tool for people to swap voices on any given song (i.e. ai music covers), a product that has contributed to 10% of the world's music library, within 3 month of release.

Can't tell you how many times I've heard that. Because I've consistently found and applied emerging technologies to real business problems before commercial solutions became mainstream. 

Classically trained on corporate software dev and project management, I became one of the very first digital marketers, leading execs from P&G, Kraft, BMW, J&J and others to take their very first steps onto the commercial web, e-commerce, and social media.

• Enterprise SaaS (VC-backed ~$50M, B-Round)
• E-Commerce Agency (bootstrapped)
• Consumer Tech (bootstrapped)

During this journey, I've been fortunate enough to work with some of the most passionate, caring, and driven people in the world. Building businesses and uniting a diverse set of people to accomplish a shared vision and mission is what I love.

My most recent venture was Alyce - www.alyce.com, acquired in February 2024. This enterprise SaaS platform made gifting not just a marketing and sales tool, but also a mindset and approach to creating authentic business relationships. Tens of thousands of marketers and sellers used Alyce to strengthen their most important connections, all while making a positive impact on the world.

Before Alyce, I founded One Pica (now Astound Digital), a global e-commerce agency. I was a part of this company until its acquisition in December 2012. During my time there, I helped build some of the largest commerce and supply chain infrastructures in the world for companies like 3M and Scholastic.

I've also helped grow and facilitate the acquisitions of several retailers, taking them from six-figure revenue to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue in just a few years. It's all about execution.

In addition to building businesses, I am passionate about mentoring and advising women and underrepresented founders, especially having a daughter who I want to see have every opportunity I have had.

My #5to9: I'm a fitness enthusiast and peanut butter nut (dad joke). I also love recreational sports -- baseball, softball, and basketball -- but I tend to get a little too competitive and sometimes end up injuring myself.

I'm always on the lookout to participate in the next big opportunity and I'm fascinated by new frontiers in consumer and enterprise products and tech, the applications of generative AI across every industry, and the future of commerce.

I have a few things cookin'... but I'm always open to exploring new opportunities and having conversations with like-minded people.",49,,Board Member,Vizit,Alyce,9 yrs 9 mos,CEO and Co-Founder,See Fit,Boston University,"BFA - Graphic Design, Design, Computer Science, Art History, Fine Art",Joel Barlow HS,,User Interface Design,E-commerce,Business Strategy,CRM,CMS,0,,,0,0.0,neutral,,,,"Founded and led three companies with two successful exits including Alyce acquired in 2024; Over 30 years of experience in private equity, corporate finance, and capital markets; Expertise in distressed investing, turnarounds, restructurings, and reorganizations; Speaker and lecturer on business management and finance topics; Active civic engagement and leadership roles in public service and nonprofit organizations",L4,"Greg Segall demonstrates a strong track record as a serial entrepreneur with multiple exits, though not at unicorn scale.

I launched our first automated grocery pick-up experience service at Walmart, led the go-to-market for three new products at Casa Lumbre, and founded two companies. To name a few.

Pass me your paper napkin, I’ll figure out how to translate it into something tangible, with real business results. I do this by...

IDENTIFYING CUSTOMER OPPORTUNITIES - I use qualitative and quantitative research to uncover consumer insights and articulate a clear business problem to solve.
  - Developed the customer target and determined the market white space to successfully position three new craft liquor brands at Casa Lumbre
  - Initiated a customer discovery process and feedback loop to understand the needs of new founders in the Startup Leadership program and built programming that achieved a 90+ NPS

USING DATA TO ITERATE - I leverage scorecards and analytics to inform the success of my projects and rely on leading indicators to pivot as needed.
  - Built the performance marketing planning for Ella & Oak and adjusted the marketing mix to achieve a 50% increase in bride sign-ups
  - Designed a funnel scorecard to track our customer journey at aifleet and optimized our process to achieve a 40% increase in efficiency 

BUILDING STRONG TEAMS - I see potential, set high expectations, and coach for success against clear KPIS.
  - Created the aifleet recruiting department to scale truck driver hires to 250+ annually
  - Attracted 30+ volunteers to Comedians at Call to participate in our weekly hotline with 100% retention.

about me:

👨‍💻 I'm a sales rep turned startup founder. 

🇲🇽🗽🍑 I spent a year and a half remote working in Mexico. We built most of Lavender during this. I'm based in New York but we got our start in Atlanta. 

🎨 🏛 I've been designing software since I was a kid, but went to school to study Government and Economics. 

🌍 I'm passionate about entrepreneurship. I wrote my senior thesis on using micro-finance to encourage entrepreneurship and bottoms-up development of emerging economies.

🦊 I'm most proud of starting a series of campaigns to help save a historic women's college, Sweet Briar, from closing. 

👩‍🎓The school was saved by its alumnae, and this experience led me to leave my job and start my first startup: an alumni social chat and mobile fundraising app. 

🧠 Through that I was introduced to the cognitive sciences, met my co-founders, and pivoted. We built technology for marketers that leveraged personality and decision making science.

💜 COVID happened and we pivoted again, applying our communication psychology research to sales.

🙌 Now Lavender helps thousands of sales people around the world write better emails faster.

Healthcare is not immune to innovation, it just acts like it. Our mission at Included Health is to raise the standard of healthcare for everyone. We create the products and culture to power better results for patients everywhere, now and in future. 

How? By making healthcare easier to understand, navigate, and afford. By providing healthcare that’s EQ + AI, tech-powered and human-driven. It includes everything: acute and chronic, physical and behavioral, in-person and virtual, medical and administrative. 

I’ve always been passionate about product strategy, not just what we’re building but how we build it. Before IH, I co-founded Reputation.com and grew it into the worldwide leader in online reputation and privacy management. Earlier, I pioneered eBay's unstructured data approach for understanding buyer behavior. My interest in healthcare began even earlier, in Accenture’s Health and Life Sciences practice. 

This work is complex so the solutions we provide can be simple. So being named one of the World Economic Forum’s Global Technology Pioneers, one of Goldman Sachs’ Top 50 Builders + Innovators, and Rock Health’s Most Beloved CEOs matters to me. It’s a direct reflection of the hard work and success of those around me, from engineers to clinicians, care team to admins. 

We're looking forward. Future healthcare will be powered by data, so clinicians know instantly who you are and how you want to be taken care of. It will make possible both digital and in-person experiences, at the right time, for speed, ease, and accuracy. It’ll be connective, including more people and providers. And it’ll be contextual, understanding your job, language, spiritual practice, and cultural identity all matter to your health.

Ever since I am on a journey to explore, shape and create impact which I will be proud to look back on, on my own death bed.

With an insatiable curiosity for human behavior, ADHD and the mission to understand what it means to make a – my – life worthwhile, it wasn't always easy, as you can imagine. 

Now, with over a decade of fascination, study and experience in the field, I can say, I found my dharma (ikigai) – I support people in finding Meaning in their lives. 

Specifically, I work with high-impact leaders, founders, and entrepreneurs who have built success on the outside, but are asking the deeper questions on the inside: ""Is this it?"" and ""What's the next chapter of my life?""

How do I help answer those questions? With holistic approaches in three domains:

1. Through my company, Kinisi. As Founder & CEO, I lead a team of expert therapists who facilitate our boutique, legal psychedelic journeys in the Netherlands. While psychedelics are not the panacea for getting a ""better life"", they are unparalleled tools to gain clarity, momentum and reconnect to oneself. If you're interested in personal development, biohacking and healing, you should definitely be looking at psychedelics as the next-gen performance tool. If you want to be ahead of the curve, come talk to me ;-)

2. As a healing practitioner (in training) I coach individuals by creating individualised habit protocols that seamlessly integrate in their every day busy lives. With over a decade of experiences and trainings in various domains and my superpower (feeling) up my toolbelt, alchemising just what the individual needs comes very natural to me. And brings me endless joy.

3. My creative outlet has been writing for a while and I recently started sharing my learnings and ideas on Substack: @sophiesharper – follow me for some entertainment education! 

Across all these domains, my mission is the same: to provide the tools and containers for leaders to do the deep inner work that unlocks their next level of purpose and performance.

Kinisi,Active,Brennand Pierce,Building Kinisi Robotics: Practical humanoids for today's problems,https://www.linkedin.com/in/brennandpierce,United States,"At Kinisi, we don't sell science fiction. We build robots that actually get work done. By equipping practical, wheeled-base humanoids with the latest LLM intelligence, we make them adaptable to any problem in any warehouse. Unlike wobbly bipeds, our bots are smart, speedy, scalable, and safe to work alongside humans so we can solve today's labor shortages. I've shipped over 25,000 robots at my previous startups, and my co-founder Ed Lando has founded unicorn startups that have raised hundreds of millions. But with just $2M raised to date, Kinisi is pioneering the future of physical intelligence where we don't mimic human biology — we outperform it. 

If you ship fast and want to see your work in the real world, not just in demo videos, reach out here https://www.kinisi.com/careers


I've spent the last 15 years founding robotics startups because I hate inefficiency. I turned my childhood bedroom into a robotics lab and started the UK's first robot fighting league while working in warehouses and factories. But after a job made me unscrew 1000 screws manually, I knew my mission was to build practical bots that take hard labor off of people's shoulders. 

I spent a decade in academia, researching humanoid locomotion for my PhD, before founding Bear Robotics. Funded with $180M by investors like SoftBank, we built waiter bots that delivered millions of meals to tables. But without AI, they had to be hard-coded for each restaurant and struggled when tables were rearranged. So I spent two years advising top robotics startups while learning to design LLM-powered hardware before recruiting a team from Nvidia and Dyson. 

Now we're growing Kinisi — not by chasing hype, but by building robots that businesses pay for. And by getting the most humanoids in the field, we're collecting the training data to tackle tomorrow's industrial challenges.",37,,Founder: CEO,Kinisi Robotics · Full-time,Robotics Advisor and Consultant,Self Employed · Freelance,Co-Founder: Chief Robotics Officer,"Bear Robotics, Inc.",Technical University of Munich,"Phd Candidate, Institute for Cognitive Systems",Bristol Robotics Lab,"Master of Science (M.Sc.), Robotics",Zamp Tax,Robotics,Mobile Robotics,Entrepreneurship,Humanoids,5,,Interview on The Robot Report Podcast; Guest on Machine Minds Show podcast,0,6.0,positive,,,,,L5,"Brennand Pierce demonstrates a strong track record in robotics entrepreneurship with proven ability to raise significant funding and scale companies.

AI FOR PET,Active,Ryan Gruzen,Founder Building Trustworthy AI for Pet Health | We Save Pets' Lives,https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-gruzen,"Los Angeles, California, United States","Building technology that enhances the most important relationships in life.

Two years ago, I made a decision that surprised everyone, including myself. After 20 years building a successful video production career, I walked away to solve a problem that affects 70% of American households: what to do when your pet needs help and you don't know if it's an emergency.

The catalyst? A terrifying night with my Shih-Tzu Cooper that exposed a massive gap in pet healthcare accessibility. Between unreliable Facebook groups and $5,000 emergency vet bills, pet parents are left guessing when their companions need help most.

So I built Pet Portal AI and our Pet Health Advisor. Our specialized AI provides instant, trustworthy pet health guidance without the hallucinations that make generic AI dangerous for medical advice. We've engineered Constitutional AI principles into every response, ensuring accuracy comes first, always.

What makes this different? We're not replacing veterinarians, we're enhancing their ability to serve more families by handling the flood of ""is this an emergency?"" questions that overwhelm the system. Dr. Marty Becker called it a game-changer for addressing the service desert in pet care.

The validation has been incredible. Pet parents finally have trusted guidance in those critical moments. And when Cooper's eye required removal this year, our own system helped me navigate that heartbreaking decision. The ultimate test of technology built with love.

This isn't just a career pivot. It's a movement toward technology that actually enhances human capability rather than replacing it. Every interaction we design serves one purpose: helping pets and people live happier, healthier lives together.

Currently serving thousands of pet parents through our free beta. Because every 3 AM worry deserves a trustworthy answer.",47,,Founder,Pet Portal AI · Full-time,President/Director,Maximilian Productions Inc.,Generative AI Account Lead,Thinkable · Contract,"University of California, Santa Cruz","Film and Digital Media, Film and Digital Media",Santa Monica High School,,Pet Tech,Post Production,Commercials,Start-up Leadership,Content Development,2,,The 3 Ps of AI-Driven Veterinary Care webinar,0,6.0,positive,,,,,L2,"Ryan Gruzen appears to be an early-stage entrepreneur who has made a significant career pivot from video production to founding an AI-focused pet health startup.

He was invited by fortune 500 companies, colleges, high schools, hospitals, and youth groups to help educate the public and challenge existing stigmas and stereotypes.

Mark went on to be the first in his family to graduate college and worked for MTV, MTV Films, and VH1. Mark left working in video production and film to work at American Homecare Federation (AHF), a specialty pharmacy for people living with bleeding disorders.

He started his first business at age 12. With a unique take on the popular MMORPG World of Warcraft,  he created a virtual private server with a first-time economy built in where players could buy property, objects, houses, and interact and affect the global economy. The server became one of the most played WoW private servers. 

At age 13 he started a review video blog on YouTube, called Elite Nerds, where he would review software and hardware. This vlog later became a website gaining over 1.3 million hits a month. In the same year, he created his first mobile app called ""App List."" App List was named a ""must have for any Android user,"" by The Big App Show.

At 14 Spencer started a software company called Unparalleled Software and made two top 1 selling productivity apps which was featured on the cover of Mac|Life magazine.

At 19, he founded WeDo which became the #1 life manager for students used at over 800 schools and 1.5m users.

Next he jumped into the private sector, applying analytics on some of the world’s largest data warehouses at Teradata, a pioneer in big data technology. 

Alex was co-founder and CTO at Mtell, a company on a mission to create a world that doesn’t break down. Mtell’s machine learning platform is used to monitor global fleets of industrial assets, in effect creating a distributed immune system to protect equipment and personnel.

I'm obsessed with team performance in all of its forms, including corporate settings, sports, and even the arts. With a 25-year career as a tech founder and executive in Silicon Valley, experience at the largest companies (Google) and startups alike, publishing academic papers and being awarded more than a dozen patents in machine learning, I've seen teams perform across countless contexts. And nothing is transforming CX team performance in the enterprise like the newest breakthroughs in AI and machine learning.

Previously, I was the Founder/CTO at Wavefront (also backed by Sequoia Capital, and acquired by VMware for 9 figures). I was also early at PayPal (pre-eBay acquisition in 2002) and Google (2006) as a software engineer, and was a Founding Engineer at GLMX, the leading electronic exchange for the money markets (over $600B in daily transaction volume).

I've published multiple papers in computational biology and medical information at Stanford Medical School, and have over a dozen patents in machine learning and AI. My popular writing on machine learning has been cited in academic papers and classes at Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Seoul National University, and even a PhD thesis. I wrote a widely-read article on Generative AI back in 2017.

WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING:
“Booster Stage has been a great investment for BeOnAlert, helping us get a working product ready for initial release and testing with Beta customers in just a few short weeks.” —Diane Strutner, BeOnAlert.com

MY BACKGROUND: 
I’ve been developing web applications professionally for over 14 years for clients of all sizes. In 2008 I launched Donor Tools, a SaaS business to help nonprofits keep track of donations and raise more money online. Years of building and launching new SaaS apps has given me insight into the perils and pitfalls faced by startups and established businesses alike when creating a new web-based product. My latest venture, Booster Stage, is my way of helping founders to avoid the mistakes that can sink a new product, and steer them toward success.

I believe that everyone will survive the digital era by selling a product or service online.

As the Co-founder & CMO of Dresma, a Silicon Valley-based start-up, I am on a mission to disrupt the way visual content for online selling is created. Dresma has developed the  all in one AI-powered platform Dresma and the DoMyShoot mobile app, a self-use solution for online sellers to custom generate professional eCommerce images instantly at unprecedented scale & low cost.

Since its founding in 2019, Dresma has become recognized as a company offering powerful tools for the democratization of visual content creation. Our vision is to support 10 million online sellers to create sales-driven visual content anytime, anywhere.

To date, we have served 3000+ online businesses from 7+ countries with 9M+ images processed through our platform. 

Not only have we reduced time to market for businesses from 2 weeks to under 1 day, but have also enabled small merchants to get easy access to high quality images.

Prior to Dresma, I ran an off-shore post production services business which gave me a deep understanding of the issues faced in the content creation process by both small & large businesses . I have a demonstrated track record of creating an established, profitable business from the initial stages.

Before I got into the reins of entrepreneurship, I was a corporate communications trainer, & have consulted with top companies in India, including ITC, Wipro, Genpact & Convergys.

Being a mother of 2 girls  and an entrepreneur, I am extremely passionate about issues pertaining to women in the workforce and strive to make a positive change, starting with the Dresma team.

Impact Observatory,Active,Steve Brumby,CEO/Co-founder at Impact Observatory,https://www.linkedin.com/in/stevenbrumby,"Washington, District of Columbia, United States","I am the Co-Founder and CEO/CTO of Impact Observatory, a mission-driven technology company bringing AI-powered geospatial monitoring to environment, climate, and sustainability risk analysis. Impact Observatory produced the world’s first fully automated, high resolution (10m) land use and land cover annual maps using deep learning at global scale in commercial cloud, released as a digital public good via our partners Esri Living Atlas and Microsoft Azure Planetary Computer. Impact Observatory's maps are also available via the UN Biodiversity Lab (powered by Impact Observatory), and have been used by the New York Times to analyze the impact of catastrophic flooding in Pakistan due to the climate crisis. Steve recently served on the Department of the Interior's Landsat Advisory Group. 

At National Geographic Society, I built and led a team to advise exploration and conservation programs, applying machine learning and scientific modeling to remotely sensed imagery and signals (satellites, aircraft, and drones), in situ networks (animal trackers, autonomous cameras and other sensors) and citizen explorer contributed datasets. We created and visualized these datasets to further the Society's mission of achieving a planet in balance through data-driven conservation, including supporting the largest scientific mission to take climate sensors to the top of Mount Everest in 2019.

I was the technical co-founder for Descartes Labs, a venture-backed company focused on understanding human activity and natural resources at global scale in real time through scientific datasets. Descartes Labs initial products serve agricultural, financial, insurance, and government/policy sectors with automated imagery analysis and business intelligence services. Descartes Labs was spun out of Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) in December 2014, where I was a Senior Research Scientist and Principal Investigator for LANL's Video Analysis & Search Technology (VAST), a neuroscience-inspired deep-learning algorithm for labeling social media video at scale. I led a team of 16 scientists applying deep learning to social media, surveillance video, satellite imagery and microscopy (biological and man-made materials). VAST ran on LANL's High Performance Computing systems and we were the first team at LANL to extend our work to commercial cloud systems (Amazon AWS). Prior to my deep learning research, I was co-inventor of a genetic algorithm system for image analysis called GENIE, that won an R&D Magazine R&D100 award in 2002, used for remote sensing and digital pathology applications.",53,,CEO/CTO & Co-Founder,Impact Observatory,National Geographic,2 yrs 10 mos,Senior Fellow,World Resources Institute,University of Melbourne,"Ph.D., Theoretical Physics",University of Melbourne,"B.Sc.(Hons.), Physics",Time Series Analysis,Theory,Signal Processing,Image Analysis,Scientific Computing,5,R&D Magazine R&D100 award co-author for GENIE machine learning system (2002),Speaker at IUCN Leaders Forum 2024; Speaker at SXSW 2023,,8.0,positive,,,,,L4,"Steve Brumby demonstrates strong technical leadership and entrepreneurial experience with multiple ventures.

You don’t need another Figma file. You need execution.

I help pre-seed founders go from concept to a fully designed and functional product in 90 days—with the right product, growth, and fundraising strategy to land their next round.

What You Get in 90 Days
✅ A fully designed & built React frontend
→ I led the component library strategy that helped Zenefits scale, making iteration fast and seamless.

✅ Product strategy & PLG model
→ At Yammer, we practically invented PLG—this isn’t theory, it’s what works.

✅ Fundraising strategy & brand work
→ The brands I’ve worked with have raised over $400M collectively—I know what makes investors say yes.

Why Work With Me?
I've built and led design, product, and growth teams at Yammer, Zenefits, Eaze, and Viable, and I’ve helped multiple startups scale fast by getting their product and GTM strategy right from day one.

Most early-stage startups make the same mistakes:
❌ Overbuilding an MVP that never launches
❌ Skipping go-to-market planning
❌ Wasting months on branding that doesn’t convert

I fix this.

Who I Work With
🔥 Pre-seed & early-stage founders who are serious about building a product that actually gains traction.

If you're ready to move fast and want execution, not just strategy, let's talk.

Her clients span a wide range of industries, and include globally recognized leaders like Porsche, Disney, PepsiCo, Bayer AG, Nike, A24, and Sundance Institute. DeeDee’s process for criteria-based trend identification separates signal from noise, and her techniques for visualizing future scenarios provide detailed inputs for opportunity framing and concept development.

In the 1990s, DeeDee created The L Report, the first publication to track trend diffusion in youth culture. She also founded Look-Look, the first online platform that let people report on their own culture. Look-Look evolved into a custom marketing agency and the first user-generated arts magazine. Both are now academic case studies.

Recognizing a need for precision and respondent quality in the nascent online research industry, DeeDee founded the-Collaboratory, a personally vetted online database of consumers, mavens and experts that provides input for a broad range of diverse projects.

She was also Innovation President of Sterling Brands, an award-winning branding and design agency, where she published On The Future, a trends report of potential future products and services. 

Pulling together learning and discoveries across these diverse experiences, DeeDee developed a proprietary, integrated system that combines her behavioral insights, trends identification and future visualization skills in a single discipline: Applied Futures Thinking™.

DeeDee’s latest endeavor, The Gordon Co, is a bold new approach to the full-service agency model that prioritizes strategic clarity as well as future vision—streamlined for a new era, imbued with the wisdom of seasoned partners, capable of researching, strategizing, planning and executing—all with a lean, dedicated, multitalented team. The-Collaboratory still plays a key role in understanding consumers, while a vast network of experts, specialized researchers and experienced creatives often collaborate on project execution. Capabilities span every aspect of branding, from high-level strategy to product development and communication campaigns.

DeeDee’s work is featured in many articles, textbooks and case studies, and in a broad range of media, like Fast Company, Vogue, The New Yorker, Time Magazine, The New York Times, NPR, PBS Frontline and Malcolm Gladwell’s The Tipping Point.

I spent a year interviewing Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, for my book, ""The Billionaire and The Mechanic."" This story, like the others I gravitate to, is about those underdogs who dare to go after what others say is impossible. They are relentless in their pursuits and brilliant in their often risky solutions. They don't succeed alone.

All of my training as a storyteller serves me well as a founder and CEO. Stories have the power to open doors and minds and jumpstart industries. Through the right stories, companies can better recruit, retain, and advance their employees.

HeadsUp,Active,Andrew Cook,Founder of HeadsUp | Passionate about transforming organizations through AI-driven employee engagement.,https://za.linkedin.com/in/andrew-cook-723b785,South Africa,"I’ve always believed that exceptional service - whether to customers or employees - isn’t just a strategy. It’s a mindset. A non-negotiable. Over the years, I’ve built businesses, scaled technology platforms, and invested in ideas that make people’s lives and work better. Today, my focus has expanded from customer experience to the full spectrum of employee experience - because I’ve learned the two are inseparable.

As the founder of HeadsUp, I’m building a platform that uses AI and real-time data to help companies become more human - not less. We help leaders see beneath the surface: uncovering disengagement before it becomes attrition, surfacing burnout risks, and turning feedback into action. Our mission is clear: better work cultures, better performance, better outcomes for everyone.

I’ve had the privilege of founding and scaling Smoke CI, Africa’s premier Voice of the Customer platform, and serving on the boards of tech and wellness ventures like PayCurve. Whether designing new tech or rethinking an old problem, I care most about delivering meaningful value; to employees, to customers, and to the businesses that serve them.

Most recently, I’ve joined the founding group behind CHRO LEAD, a movement designed to reimagine HR’s influence in business and society. We believe HR leaders should be at the center of strategy - not on the sidelines. And we’re actively shaping the future of the profession to reflect that belief.

My journey has crossed industries, borders, and disciplines - but the thread is constant: helping organisations unlock the power of people.

SparkAI,Active,Jacob Gephart,Founder | SparkAI Consulting,https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacobgephart28,"Cherry Hill, New Jersey, United States","As the founder of multiple ventures, my career in business began in the pet industry, where I launched and successfully sold two companies: Portfolio Pet and Worthy Wags. These ventures—ranging from custom pet portraits to curated wellness subscription boxes—gave me hands-on experience in operations, digital marketing, customer experience, and financial management.

I later joined SocialLadder as an Account Executive, where I helped the platform enter the subscription box market through strategic micro-influencer partnerships. That role sharpened my skills in partnership development and brand growth strategy. Following that, I served as a Financial Services Professional at Evolution Financial Group, deepening my understanding of financial planning, long-term business viability, and client consulting.

Through these diverse roles, I realized that no matter the industry—whether it’s pets, finance, or tech—the businesses that grow sustainably are the ones that understand their operations deeply and apply smart systems to scale them efficiently.

That insight led me to launch SparkAI Consulting.

Like many, I was captivated by AI’s potential—but also disillusioned by the flood of tools that overpromise, confuse, and often fail to deliver for real-world service businesses. AI has been marketed with tech jargon, overhyped chatbots, and platforms that leave business owners feeling overwhelmed, not empowered.

At SparkAI Consulting, we do things differently. We don’t sell one-size-fits-all software. We partner directly with HVAC companies and other service businesses to:
Understand their workflow and pain points

Recommend and integrate tailored AI tools

Train their teams and provide ongoing support
