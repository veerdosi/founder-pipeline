Kai AI,Kai Ai,https://fr.linkedin.com/in/kai-ai-42bb70346,L1,0.68,"Based on the extremely limited profile information and apparent early-stage nature of their current venture, this appears to be a nascent founder with minimal verifiable experience. The profile shows only one role as CEO of their current company KAI, with no prior work experience, education details, or skills listed.

While he has professional experience in sales and business development, there's no clear evidence of prior successful exits, major funding rounds, or significant scale achievements. His current venture Arcee.ai is in the emerging AI/ML space, and his role as Co-Founder + CRO suggests he's leveraging his sales background in a founder capacity. His previous experience at Hugging Face (a notable AI company) provides relevant industry experience, but this appears to be his first founder role, placing him in the L2 category as an early-stage entrepreneur showing promise but without proven entrepreneurial outcomes yet.",,,
Drishan Arora,Deep Cogito,https://www.linkedin.com/in/drishanarora,L1,0.68,"Based on the available information, this appears to be a first-time founder with a strong educational background but limited professional track record. The founder has a Master's degree in Computer Science from Columbia University, which provides technical credibility, but is currently working on their first startup (Deep Cogito) with no prior founding or significant industry experience listed. The ambitious goal of 'building general superintelligence' suggests early-stage entrepreneurial ambition, fitting the L1 'Nascent Founders with Potential' profile. The lack of prior work experience or achievements in the profile, combined with the academic background, strongly suggests this is an early-career founder.",,,
Dhruv Malrana,Deep Cogito,https://www.linkedin.com/in/drvdhruv,L1,0.68,"Based on the available information, this appears to be a first-time founder with strong academic credentials (IIT Delhi) but limited professional track record. While the founder claims DeepMind experience in their title ('ex-DeepMind'), this isn't detailed in the experience section, making it difficult to verify. The current venture Deep Cogito appears to be their first founding experience.

Noa Flaherty,Vellum.ai,https://www.linkedin.com/in/noaflaherty,L2,0.68,"Noa Flaherty fits the L2 (Early-Stage Entrepreneur) profile based on several key factors: 1) They are a recent Y Combinator graduate (W23 batch), which is a strong signal of early promise and potential, 2) They are currently leading their first significant venture as CTO/co-founder of Vellum.ai, 3) The company is in its early stages, having gone through YC recently, 4) Their background shows breadth across technical and business roles, but doesn't yet demonstrate the depth of experience or exits that would qualify for L3 or higher. The YC acceptance and current founder role at an AI company shows promise, but they are still in the early phases of their entrepreneurial journey.",,,
Harrison Chase,LangChain,https://www.linkedin.com/in/harrison-chase-961287118,L2,0.68,"Harrison Chase fits the L2 (Early-Stage Entrepreneur) profile based on his role as co-founder of LangChain, which has shown significant early traction in the AI/ML space. LangChain has become a notable open-source project in the LLM ecosystem and has raised seed funding. His Harvard education and technical background in machine learning provide a strong foundation, but this appears to be his first major founding role. The rapid growth and adoption of LangChain in the developer community shows early promise, but without a longer track record of exits or scale achievements, L2 is the most appropriate classification.",,,

Their experience spans both technical leadership (CTO roles) and enterprise work (Hasbro development projects). The combination of technical depth (25+ years of programming experience), enterprise client work, and successful community platform building places them solidly at L4. While they've shown ability to scale platforms and lead technical teams, there's no clear evidence of major exits >$100M or unicorn-level growth that would justify a higher classification.",,,
Thomas Li,Deepnight,https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-h-li,L2,0.68,"Thomas Li shows characteristics of an early-stage entrepreneur with strong technical education and Y Combinator backing. As a current YC W24 batch founder with a Berkeley EECS degree, he fits the L2 profile of showing early promise through accelerator participation and technical capabilities.

Will Bryk,Exa,https://www.linkedin.com/in/will-bryk-963953362,L1,0.68,"Based on the available information, Will Bryk appears to be a first-time founder/CEO at Exa with limited prior professional experience shown. The minimal LinkedIn profile with only one role listed (current CEO position) and no education details suggests this is likely his first venture. The profile structure and limited history is consistent with a nascent founder at the beginning of their entrepreneurial journey. The confidence score is relatively high for an L1 classification specifically because the limited profile data itself is strong evidence of early-stage experience level - established founders typically maintain more complete professional profiles.",,,
Elias Almqvist,Exa,https://www.linkedin.com/in/almqv,L2,0.68,"The founder shows early-stage entrepreneurial characteristics typical of L2 classification. They are currently leading a YC-backed company (Exa Laboratories, YC S24) which demonstrates early validation from a prestigious accelerator.
