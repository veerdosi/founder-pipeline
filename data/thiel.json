Normally a company would only operate in stealth mode for the first couple of years. As investors may have to disclose funding a stealth startup, their names are made public, but often only a general summary description is known about the company. \"Most entrepreneurs say they are in stealth because they are worried about competitors stealing their ideas. This can be a risk if you have such a simple idea that just by hearing it, someone can replicate it.\"",
