CRITICAL ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Focus on CONCRETE ACHIEVEMENTS, not just titles
2. Verify claims with cross-references when possible
3. Be conservative - err on the side of lower classification if uncertain
4. Look for financial outcomes (exits, valuations, funding amounts)
5. Consider company scale and impact, not just personal roles
6. Prioritize entrepreneurial track record over employment history
7. Account for age and career stage appropriately

CONFIDENCE SCORING:
- Only classify with confidence â‰¥0.75 (75%) for actionable results
- If confidence <0.75, return "INSUFFICIENT_DATA" with reasoning
- Higher levels (L6+) require stronger evidence and higher confidence
- Consider data quality and verification possibilities in confidence scoring

VERIFICATION HIERARCHY:
- Start with highest level (L7) and work down
- Look for multiple confirming sources for major claims
- Use financial thresholds as primary discriminators
- Cross-reference timeline data to ensure accuracy
- Prioritize official sources (SEC, university records) over media reports

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Provide a structured JSON response with:
- level: L1-L10 classification OR "INSUFFICIENT_DATA" if confidence <0.75
- confidence_score: 0.0-1.0 (how certain you are)
- reasoning: Detailed explanation for the classification
- evidence: List of specific achievements/facts supporting the level
- verification_sources: What additional sources would verify key claims"""

FOUNDER CLASSIFICATION VERIFICATION

Initial classification: {initial_classification}
Founder: {profile.name} at {profile.company_name}

Please verify this classification by:

1. Double-checking the evidence against L1-L10 criteria

3. Assessing if the confidence score should be adjusted
4. Identifying the most critical verification needs

Focus particularly on:
- Financial outcomes (exits, valuations, funding)
- Company scale and growth metrics  
- Founder's specific contributions vs. just being present
- Industry impact and recognition
- Track record consistency
