Simbo does not train its own LLMs but enriches existing LLMs of the choice with its proprietary Symbolic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) architecture.  Symbolic RAG is a perfect combination of LLM and symbolic knowledge bases for hallucination-free Gen AI platform for enterprise applications. As a specialized use case, Simbo is using its Gen AI platform for medical practice automation. It helps healthcare providers reduce burnout and costs, by automating mundane tasks using proprietary Lossless clinical NLU. Simbo AI is currently automating following use cases: - AI Medical Scribe as an API: Simbo sends patient conversation transcript to all well known LLMs from AWS, Azure, and open-source LLMs and uses proprietary clinical note ranking algorithm to identify the best clinical note. Our algorithm optimizes the cost as well to ensure it fits the budget. - Autonomous AI Phone triage bot: Triages the patients on inbound and outbound calls to autonomously resolve tasks. It helps reduce burden on healthcare staff and reduce cost for medical practice. Simbo has invented a groundbreaking concept known as 'Lossless NLU,' powered by our proprietary BISLU platform. Lossless NLU takes text or voice input and transforms it into a structured meaning representation called Thought Representations, without losing any part of the meaning. In contrast to prevailing NLU methods that primarily predict intent and entities, Lossless NLU retains the full context. We integrate Lossless NLU with Generative AI to eliminate hallucinations and perform fact checking. In the healthcare sector, where patient well-being is of utmost importance, the presence of hallucinations is unacceptable."
