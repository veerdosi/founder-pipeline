In 1988, Wonderware transformed how machines run, with the introduction and mass commercialization of Human-Machine Interface software. Wonderware enabled the first software-based industrial revolution and is still in evidence today by Wonderware’s continued leadership position. In 1998, Lighthammer transformed manufacturing yet again with the introduction of the first Enterprise Manufacturing Intelligence platform. Lighthammer revolutionized the factory floor by bringing both real time intelligence and live synchronization with the ERP software layer. This enabled the second software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of this software (currently under the SAP MII brand). In 2008, ThingWorx catalyzed the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with the introduction of the first application platform for IIoT. ThingWorx transformed both manufacturing and service, becoming synonymous with Industrie 4.0/Brilliant factory, and Connected Service. This enabled the 3rd software-based industrial revolution and is still evidenced today by the ubiquity of IIoT software and, the market leadership of PTC’s ThingWorx brand. In 2018, the founders of Augmentir recognized that the technology and market forces were aligned yet again, for a fourth industrial software revolution. A revolution focused on increasing the productivity & quality of processes involving front-line workers. With a global footprint of 350 million workers in manufacturing and service, they are being asked to perform increasingly complex jobs using technology that has remained relatively unchanged for 20 years. Whether this was due to neglect or the misplaced belief that robots and automation would replace all of these jobs, these users and processes have been underserved."

With this and the built in language capability, our Human AI Interface is able to be a powerful conversational voice assistant on platforms like mobile, smart homes and appliances, and in your vehicle, and also perform real information and customer-facing vocations online, like Medical, Finance, Legal, and others. As the Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) core advances, it becomes more powerful, with a broader data reach, and more advanced cognition, planning, prediction, vocational and communication skills. Companies could use it to plan their corporate strategy via their current Enterprise Resource Planning tools by interfacing them to our AGI and having it watch and learn their company’s internal operations, gather data about their whole ecosystem of customers, suppliers, partners, competitors, and the other market factors, then forecast different timelines and how they evolve into the future differently according to their decisions, allowing you to optimize their corporate decision-making and plan effective prescient timelines for product development, marketing/PR, sales, finance, legal,… into the future. Ordinary people can use it to plan their lives, evaluating different decisions they could make, from career, to marriage, to finances, and to see the trajectory of events that would result, and the probable outcomes. They can access AGI professional services like Finance, Legal, Medical, Counselor, Fitness Advisor, and hundreds of others, and these services would be available globally, rivaling the best such services by humans. An Artificial General Intelligence will quickly become the most powerful tool that humanity has ever had, making the revolutions spawned by electricity, computers, and the internet pale by comparison. Where we are now overwhelmed by a world's worth of information we could never humanly assimilate in our work lives and our personal lives, we will have something that can for go through it all for us, and give us exactly what we need, when we need it."
