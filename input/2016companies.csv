Buildings are the most complex controlled infrastructure in the world, however, they are often fitted with technologically stagnant and expensive control systems that waste energy and provide sub-optimal occupant comfort. The consequence of this inefficiency is that buildings account for more than 40% of the entire world's energy usage.  Autonomous buildings are the key to addressing this energy challenge and unlocking the future of cities. PassiveLogic’s autonomous building platform, powered by Quantum - the physics-based digital twin standard for autonomous systems, has proven 30% energy savings compared to conventional control systems. Applying this scalable technology across the entire U.S. building sector alone creates a net savings opportunity of 9.6 Quads per year—the equivalent of taking 1/3 of all U.S. vehicles off the road.

That is why we developed CytoCatch™, a patent-pending technology that enables the performance of a CTC blood-based assay that has the potential of being used for early cancer detection and monitoring of the applied treatments’ effectiveness. This technology consists of an isolation platform, which automatically performs the necessary steps to process the sample, capturing the CTCs contained in it, and an imaging system, which possesses special routines and machine learning algorithms that analyze the captured cells based on their morphology and the expression of specific markers. The fact that all these processes are fully automated increases the reliability and reproducibility of the assay by preventing human errors and cell loss due to manual steps. Furthermore, the collected cells are compatible with traditional molecular biology techniques and next-generation technologies, enabling the performance of molecular analysis to assess the genetic characteristics of the captured CTCs.  This innovative technology will enable a broad range of cancer-related clinical applications."

These failures equate to billions of dollars in lost opportunity for trial sponsors every year - but more importantly, patients don't have time to wait for us to get it right.  In the digital age, humans cannot physically read and digest every bit of information relevant to a given decision. In addition, almost every organization has what is called 'dark' or 'siloed' data – valuable data that is not being used, or that organizations don’t know they have at their disposal. It is estimated that as much as 90% of the data within a given organization is dark or siloed. As a result, pharmaceutical companies are making important decisions with incomplete information.  ENTER TRIALS.AI - we are on a mission to get effective treatments to patients faster by using artificial intelligence to optimize clinical trial designs for speed and success.  Unlike the current service models out there, we use smart technology to harness vast amounts of data that no human can process – then offer unique insights across therapeutic areas to trial sponsors.

Traditional computer systems (CPUs) were designed to be easily programmable, which allowed technology to permeate every facet of daily life. But the software those systems ran only got faster as a result of the doubling of performance every 2 years (Moore’s Law), which has recently come to an end. Software has gotten more complex and data sets are growing exponentially, creating the need for a new chip platform. Recently, the industry has resorted to building single purpose systems (ASICs) that are impossible to reprogram. These hardware-only (chip) solutions are incredibly expensive, take years to develop and deploy (3+ years), and run the risk of being obsolete by the time they are ready, making them poor investments for the rapidly changing software and environments they are meant to enable. SimpleMachines’s solution is a radically new software-centric approach to the problem that deploys a programmable platform with a breakthrough software stack that enables the programmer to easily optimize the hardware on the fly and get the performance of custom silicon with a platform that supports hundreds of different use cases."

To be a trusted doctor, they need to have good references and work history. Every doctor’s credentials are manually verified before they are allowed to be part of trusted-doctor ecosystem. Additionally, one of the big pain for doctors is “patient review websites”, Many companies are doing it however those companies tend to be biased towards people who are advertising on their platform. This has caused frustration for many great doctors who are good however since they don’t pay, they are penalized directly or indirectly by “patient review websites”.  Trusted-doctor.com “would not” and “shall not” take any money “in any form” to promote any doctor or show them as sponsored results on top All the doctors would be ranked without bias based on reviews from patients and the value the trusted doctor provides to the community. Company is building advanced data science AI algorithms to make sure system remains totally honest and transparent  Every trusted-doctor gets their own personalized profile page, This helps doctors in getting high visibility on internet and on other websites like Google, Yahoo, Bing, Facebook etc. Trusted-doctor.com helps patients in getting second opinion and their primary doctors can refer them to other trusted doctors. This way, patients can have the piece of mind. Think about it, a patient in India or China can get a second opinion on their medical condition from a doctor in USA or Europe To ensure success for this noble mission, the company is supported by a 501c(3) non-profit.
