AI That Builds Itself: Agents triage gaps, create new specialized agents on demand, and continuously evolve without human intervention. Agents refine their own intelligence, validate their outputs, and scale autonomously, delivering solutions that get smarter, faster, and more precise over time. Built for enterprise scale, with on-premise or cloud deployment, SOC2 compliance, built-in governance, and seamless integration into your existing systems.

It offers various features to overcome the common challenges faced by businesses including; disorganized work, lack of focus, miscommunication, uncertain team morale, and inadequate planning. With AI power, it plans your day for you. We believe that to achieve success as a team, it's important for each individual to effectively plan their day and adhere to the plan. During the planning stage, 3 main questions need to be answered: “what do I need to work on?”, “how long will it take?” and, “how much time do I have?”.  Planning is important, but not enough by itself for success. Individuals need to maintain their focus throughout the execution of the plan. For ultimate focus, it is essential to minimize the distractions caused by unnecessary messages, switching between unfinished tasks, and losing track of time. With BeforeSunset’s workspace, you can plan your day by reviewing yesterday’s achievements, and unfinished tasks. You can stay on schedule throughout the day by keeping track of time for each task and focusing on one task at a time.  By tracking the time spent on each task, you can ensure that work is progressing as planned and make adjustments as needed. With analytics provided by BeforeSunset close your day by reviewing and reflecting on the progress you made. This detailed daily and weekly analysis can help you identify areas for improvement and plan your future work accordingly. Since work is not all we have, it is important to include personal planning in your day to make sure your daily plan is accurate. This doesn’t mean all your teammates see your personal todos on BeforeSunset. Our tool has the capability to make todos private if the user chooses. BeforeSunset's ""Team Timeline"" feature is designed for team members to share updates with the team such as; the task they're currently working on, their availability, meeting status, daily mood, whether they're working remotely or on-site, and who is currently working or taking time off. This helps keep everyone on the same page, prevent miscommunication, and minimize the need for additional communication. To sustain and improve productivity, reflection is provided by BeforeSunset’s analytics. These reports include information such as completed vs. unfinished tasks, meeting analytics, mood analytics, and how much effort the team spent on each tag."

Its white-label solution and APIs drive cardholder engagement while unlocking new revenue streams. Think Shopify for loyalty and travel. Current travel loyalty programs offer limited customizations, low engagement, high development cost, and lack of embedded financial features. We are solving the serious customer retention problem and lack of card use in the credit card industry today. There are more banks issuing more rewards credit cards than ever before and there are only a finite number of ways to differentiate your product on the issuing side. Yet there are really only two players on the acquiring side when it comes to travel redemption, Expedia and Booking.com. Banks know travel redemption is the solution to their problem. They just don't know how to do it properly. Odynn makes your cardholders stickier and generates significant revenue in a way that not only benefits your customers but also makes them happy! We know the name of the game is retention. Odynn not only increases retention and reduces churn, but also increases card spend, reduces CAC, provides diversified revenue, and ultimately increases customer lifetime value.  Our B2B partners can:  License our loyalty pricing and/or Traveler DNA APIs for standard SaaS fees Embed our white label loyalty travel portal charged per user Embed our holistic travel portal as a white label, where we pay our partners upwards of 70% of the net travel booking commissions Subscribe to our loyalty pricing data priced per volume"

Hour25.ai has developed and tested a unique mobile platform that increases focus by detecting for the user, in real-time, when his emotional state has driven him into the ‘hands’ of social networks. Then - help the employee boost attention using behavioral interventions targeted by these focus-negative feelings.  For example, when they validate that they’re bored, we provide them with a psychological exercise (video, quiz, short reading, music, etc.) to shift their focus towards where their focus lane is. For example - the boredom quiz asks them questions that help them understand the core reasons they are bored, which pulls them out of the unwanted emotional situation. AS a B2B company - we're targeted to provide a solution to many employers seeking to increase precious employees' productivity while ensuring they are happy.

Wrong.  Polling companies miss election results by enormous margins. Financial ""gurus"" say XYZ will go up, and you end up losing your life savings. Sports commentators give a complete explanation why Team A will defeat Team B, and after the match, they explain with a straight face why Team A didn't stand a chance. Well, but after that they lose all their prestige and followers, right? Wrong again. Nobody keeps a track record, and in the current state of affairs, fame and merit don't necessarily correlate. So, who are the best at predicting their own field of expertise?  It is impossible to know...until now. Join Halley to find the best predictions and learn together who are the real Gurus on your subject of choice."
