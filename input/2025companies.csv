Current AI tools like chatbots and copilots operate in silos, lack coordination, and offer little to no real-time oversight — making them fundamentally unfit for the complex, high-stakes, role-based workflows in regulated industries like healthcare, finance, insurance, and government. This results in inefficiencies, risks, and a failure to scale AI beyond narrow, single-point tasks. Dipp AI is building the human-AI interaction platform for orchestrating superintelligent multi-agent systems across complex mission-critical enterprise workflows in industries like healthcare, insurance, finance and government. More specifically, we’re building a platform with three core components: Agent Mesh Orchestration Engine A coordination layer that enables multiple AI agents—each with specific roles, permissions, and specializations—to collaborate on complex tasks. These agents can reason, delegate, and escalate across systems, breaking beyond the limits of single-agent copilots. Role-Based Directive Interface A structured UI and API layer that allows human experts in any function—clinical, financial, operational—to issue directives to the agent mesh in natural or formal language. This supports dynamic collaboration, not just static task automation. Real-Time Oversight and Governance Layer A virtualization and feedback interface that lets humans supervise, intervene, and audit agent decisions in real time. This layer enforces accountability, traceability, and compliance—critical for regulated industries. Together, these components form a unified platform for deploying safe, scalable, and auditable AI systems in domains where workflows are too complex and sensitive for copilots alone."

While our initial focus is in FinTech, our vision extends beyond finance. As the company grows, we are committed to dedicating all of our engineering efforts to the development of AI-driven agents, expanding into new sectors and unlocking transformative use cases through applied artificial intelligence. At Nexia Capital, we’re not just building technology — we’re shaping the future of specialized, market-driven AI solutions. By leveraging the latest technologies and low-code platforms, we avoid reinventing the wheel and instead focus on building powerful solutions on top of existing tools to address challenges that current technologies can’t yet solve. We are currently open to selling up to 10% of the company in exchange for $2 million in funding. The capital will be used to acquire equipment and expand our operations beyond the financial sector. We are seeking one or more strategic investors who can not only support this round of financing but also contribute with connections, strategic input, and a collaborative role in shaping our growth plans and decision-making processes."
