But did you know that 37% of business opportunities received through email are not answered by Client Services Consultants and that 55% of churn intentions are conveyed through email? Or that 32% of emails containing requests have at least one instance of client insistence?  On average, a bank can lose $5,000 USD monthly per executive due to unanswered or belatedly-addressed business opportunities and churn threats.  So, what can we do? As team leaders we deal with extremely manual processes, such as asking for screenshots of inboxes, assigning teams to read and label emails daily, requesting consultants to transfer their email data to Excel, and buying CRM or sales software. However, we keep having the same problem and wish for a tool that would allow us to automate the process while giving us the visibility we need.   The solution already exists. At Wholemeaning we work with native Spanish Artificial Intelligence to create a tool that helps Sales and After-Sales Managers prioritize their emails and workload. Additionally, we provide real-time indicators to supervisors in order to control and improve daily management of their teams. As a result, we are able to help Consultants, Supervisors, Sales and Post-Sales Managers reach their satisfaction, retention, and sales goals, resulting in significantly more efficient teams (prioritization through the plugin, reports, and alerts all in real time)."

A hypercloud is a 100% software configurable virtual datacenter that lives on top of physical hardware securely in your private datacenter, on the public clouds of AWS, GCE, and Azure, and on your laptop. Virtual Machines tax performance.  Containers are too new and insecure, forcing you to redesign app deployment flow. The hypercloud unit of computation is the Terminal Machine (TM, or just Terminal).  TMs are the best of both worlds: you get the security and familiarity of full operating system instances with the bare-metal speed and efficiency of containers. TMs rebalance and migrate seamlessly without reboot to maximize efficiency of your cluster.  Terminals resize from 1 CPU to 32 CPUs and 50GB of RAM when you need the power, in seconds, with no reboot. They automatically pause or shrink back down to save you money. “The software-defined data center is 10 years away,” they say. “The public cloud is too insecure,” they say. The hypercloud is the best of both worlds: you get the abstraction and power of the cloud, with the security of running everything in your own datacenter, plus the benefits of a hybrid cloud if you want both. Today. Who uses Terminal.com? Our users range from web app developers who spin up copies of their website in 5 seconds for QA and testing, to neuroscientists who analyze large FMRI datasets on computers that scale instantly, to online schools who teach people how to code using Terminal.com. RailsBridge relies on Terminal.com to teach first-time female engineers to code Ruby on Rails.  Top consultants at ZS Associates crunch numbers on our platform for data science tasks every day.  Professors at Carnegie-Mellon use Terminal.com to teach 100-student courses with no wasted effort.  Engineers across Silicon Valley know that Terminal.com is the easiest and most powerful tool for conducting coding interviews. Terminal.com provides the full suite of tools for the modern developer. How did Terminal.com start? When Varun Ganapathi’s family moved from India to Boston, Massachusetts in the 1980's, they started a small company called Terminal Exchange Systems. The company provided terminals to local companies so that they could remotely access huge, main-frame computers. Varun Ganapathi helped his father carry machines door to door, renting out both the hardware and software to local businesses. As he grew up, Varun’s commitment to computing didn’t disappear. He completed his computer science PhD at Stanford, sold over 1 million copies of his paid photography mobile app, Pro HDR, and sold his second company, Numovis, to Google. After two years as a Google Senior Research Scientist, Varun asked his father if he could use the company domain name, Terminal.com. Varun explained that he had plans for it, but this time there would be no need to carry hardware door to door. Today, Varun and his San Francisco-based team rent out browser-based virtual machines that they call Terminals to thousands of users across the globe giving them access to the infinite resources of the cloud. Users ranging from online education students to Dev-Ops professionals can now start, resize, and scale their own Terminals in a matter of seconds. Inside each Terminal, they discover an intuitive interface for creating, editing, and sharing programs. And they don’t even have to wait for them to be delivered to their door."

Focusing initially on the marketing sector, Panamplify automates best practices for marketing campaigns enabling executives to take action based on business outcomes for all of their marketing related campaigns and activities. A common approach to building an easy-to-use reporting system is to cut an enterprise system down to size by restricting features and providing a lot of pre-canned content. They tried that, and found it was almost, but not quite, good enough: in too many cases they had to drop down to custom code to get everything they needed, and that wiped out most of our productivity gains. Panamplify is taking a different approach: building systems that know enough about the domain being reported on to operate at a higher level of abstraction. This helps us avoid the brittleness we encountered using ordinary templates. The system's knowledge is in the form of traditional artificial intelligence structures like rules, ontologies and plans. The use of these mechanisms allows the system to produce results that humans can understand and modify."

A home is a consumer's largest asset, liability and expense, and housing is the largest debt and equity market in the US.  Despite this, the businesses that assume the risks associated with a housing decision don’t currently have a way to quantify in advance the risks that they and their customers are taking on.  DwellAware solves this problem by helping these businesses predict the risks and reduce their costs. We do this by digitizing critical, but previously non-existent information about homes and neighborhoods.  We then analyze this proprietary information to identify and predict the unique risks for their business and their customers. Our insights significantly reduce the information asymmetry that currently exists for these businesses and their customers, and allow them to make better financial and risk assessments in advance of a business or purchase decision. Our target market includes mortgage underwriters and securities purchasers, GSEs (Fannie/Freddie/etc.) credit bureaus, insurance underwriters, utilities, brokerages, listings & rental companies, shared housing (e.g. Airbnb), home services providers, developers and private equity buyers, amongst others.
