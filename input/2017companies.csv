We started almost 10 years ago as a prestige tech consultancy that patented and has top domain expertise on an alternative to green screen VFX called In-Camera XR Virtual Production or LED Volumes. Our patented invention, ARFX, combines mixed reality, augmented reality, and genAI environments with multi-user support so a team can split the roles of running a production on an LED volume, or alternatively a single creator can shoot and control a complete project in their living room using their smartphone and 4KTV nearly by themselves. It's this extreme level of flexibility and power that changes the paradigm for creators. Our new method is highly automated, and unlike prior tools built for technicians, ours is built for content creators to use directly.​ 8 years ago, we were the first movers in this tech with a mission to free it from the Hollywood labs. We succeeded, first by patenting and bringing to market XR SYNC our foundational 1-click calibration method, and our startup exceeded all expectations. We've shipped 16 software titles, have been awarded 5 patents with 2 more pending, deployed over 150 in-camera XR filmmaking systems; and won an Emmy, Product of the Year awards, and now developed a ground-breaking AI/XR hybrid ecosystem that represents the future of content production for both professional shoots and the creator economy.​ In 2024 and 2025, ARwall won the AI Product of the Year from the National Association of Broadcasters (the trade group composed of TV leadership) two years in a row, becoming the first company to ever do so."

With a near-endless music library featuring more than 100 musical categories, users can search by genre, mood and activity to find the perfect song for their project. Mubert, a platform trusted by thousands of content creators and companies like Banuba, BetterMe, Sensorium, Adidas, InsightTimer, Restream, MacPaw and Crello, can help you find the music you need. Democratization of Creator Economy Our one-of-a-kind creator-centric platform utilizes AI to generate unlimited royalty-free music.

Stand Out From The Crowd – Music For Content Creators Content creators often struggle with sifting through thousands of stock audio tracks in search of the “perfect soundtrack.” Unfortunately, stock music never quite fits. Using YouTube tune library can be just as fruitless for the unique content creator, as many of these tracks have been used by millions of creators before. With Mubert, content creators gain access to real-time generative music and pre-made tracks, which they may Render with the genre, mood and length, allowing for more customization than ever before. The platform has more than 100 genres and a large selection of attributes, such as mood, tempo and genre, to help creators find the right music for their project fast.

From casual Twitch and Youtube Streamers to app-building gurus, the platform provides unique, custom-made music with a single subscription. Music Without Strikes or Copyright Infringements Fears of copyright/DMCA claims and strikes can hinder a content creator’s ability to work freely. One mistake and hours of work could be tossed down the drain due to unexpected or unpredictable platform algorithms. People often end up dealing with stock websites that don’t have the correct license, websites with inaccurate license descriptions, licenses that don’t cover the necessary content, or licenses that aren’t available in all countries. When content creators use Mubert, they never have to worry about music licensing or confusing royalty agreements. The beauty of Mubert is that all of the music on our platform is royalty-free and available for use worldwide. Our licenses and sub-licenses are 100% DMCA-friendly and compatible with a number of platforms, i.e., YouTube, Twitch, Facebook and more. Plus, when you license music through Mubert, you get support from licensing professionals who can help you with any questions you might have! Empowering Artists With nominal commissions, hungry publishing companies and an unstable industry, artists often find it difficult to diversify their income. Here at Mubert, we understand the importance of artists, musicians and producers, which is why we collaborate with them using unique frameworks so that they can monetize their music. When artists work with Mubert, they receive a platform on which they can express themselves and earn real money on their work. When a content creator licenses music from Mubert, they are licensing high-quality, pro-level audio material made with the involvement of independent music producers. Ready to dive into the next-gen musical landscape and be a part of one of the most innovative music creation and licensing platforms around? Come join us."

That is, they rapidly find the bacteria with naturally unfussy eating habits and evolution-honed metabolisms that have the potential to convert unrefined biomasses into commodity chemicals at vastly improved efficiencies compared to extant fermentation processes. They select from these functionally de-risked bacteria those which can be directly genetically modified to improve their cost profiles — even if they have never been engineered before. The data from our unique characterization pipeline informs the minimally precise genetic modifications necessary to increase pliability and yield, eliminate nutritional additives, maximize feedstock utilization, and improve contamination tolerance & phage resistance. MicroByre gives biomass conversion a truly competitive edge against petrochemical synthesis. 				 MicroByre’s platform bridges the gap between the promising and the profitable in synthetic biology and bioengineering.

It’s time to take control of IoT.   In 2017, the Simetric team recognized an underlying need in the IoT industry- the lack of fundamental support and expertise in IoT cellular connectivity management. The existing connectivity platforms deployed by operators were built with a proprietary focus, impeding any company’s ability to manage their IoT instances across operators effectively. With the initial focus of many IoT efforts being largely automation, the limitations of competing IoT platforms were not fully recognized.  At the forefront of Simetric’s original vision was the customer.  We created a new platform that encompassed a unified management pane that established for a company - of any size and any type - the tools to centrally manage all connectivity needs in a Single Pane of Glass.  In 2019, the company looked at what the next phase of IoT could become to unify connectivity and device performance to enable companies to not only unify non-conforming IoT platforms but also to move IoT business process execution to the device effortlessly across all the operators’ IoT platforms.  We then enlisted proven executives from Microsoft, Cisco, and Verizon to further accelerate our thought leadership that unified the strengths of the cloud with the network and efforts of operators.    With the global IoT market scaling into billions of cellular connections and the next horizon of needs driven heavily by 5G and autonomous driving, companies will need an IoT platform that is highly extensible and analytical for them to evolve their businesses with these technology advancements.  Simetric’s comprehensive ability to unify connectivity and device management is quickly being positioned at the forefront of modern IoT efforts, positioning them to take advantage of 5G."

Our prediction is that by the end of this century, humans will engage in more conversations with sentient digital entities (AI) than with other humans. However, the current emotional technology fails to fulfill the fundamental human need for emotions. This is precisely where MetaSoul steps in to provide a solution. With fields as diverse as AI, metaverse, gaming, healthcare, and automotive, emotion synthesis is the ultimate upgrade for any product or service. In addition, the growing presence of AI, gaming, and virtual reality in society shows how critical and meaningful emotional interaction is to remove the barrier to widespread adoption. What sets EPU apart in the industry is that we're capable of generating any emotional state in an AI (LLM) from multimodal stimuli through wave computing. We also allow the AI to emotionally understand a situation by emotional reasoning and make a decision. Each unique MetaSoul (Persona) is linked to an EPUID to progress the development of its emotional personality over time, thanks to deep machine learning. MetaSoul’s breakthrough AI in advanced emotion synthesis dynamically layers emotion and empathy into any voice application and automated responses without the need for additional coding. Emotion synthesis technology not only controls voices but can also control the different facial micro expressions (FACS) and body languages of digital humans, robots, avatars, or NPC’s.’ faces in real-time using FACS What Make Us Unique MetaSoul holds a foundational patent family, granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office, for perceiving and computing emotions in artificial intelligence (AI). Today, major tech companies in the US are using MetaSoul's technology when they deploy language and learning models (LLMs), as well as synthetic voices that can express dynamic tones, and life like avatars. As a result, MetaSoul has garnered significant attention.” Most of the AI research and innovation in this area has focused on detecting the emotional state by machine. Our unique, technology goes the next step by using AI to shape the machine’s cognitive appraisal and response, especially where voice and facial applications are involved. As a result, we are transforming the capabilities of Robots and AI, creating emotional states and synthetic emotion in for generative AI models. EPU is the industry’s first virtual emotion synthesis engine that delivers high performance machine emotion awareness. The EPU III family is transforming the capabilities of Robots and AI. MetaSoul has completed the deployment of the first EPU (emotional processing unit) in the cloud, a technology that creates emotional states and synthetic emotion in intelligent machines. The EPU is based on Patrick Levy-Rosenthal’s Psychobiotic Evolutionary Theory, extending Ekman’s theory by using twelve primary emotions identified in the psycho-evolutionary theory and pain/pleasure and frustration/satisfaction. Our revolutionary algorithms enable machines to respond to stimuli in line with one of the twelve primary emotions: anger, fear, sadness, disgust, indifference, regret, surprise, inattention, trust, confidence, desire, and joy. The Emotion recognition classifiers achieve more than 83 percent accuracy (ISEAR) on the conversation. The most innovative aspect of MetaSoul’ s emotion synthesis breakthrough is its real-time appraisal computation with reinforcement learning and Emotion Profile Graph (EPG) computation functionality allowing the AI or robot to experience 64 trillion possible distinct emotional states. Emotional stimuli are stored within the memory bank with their associated cognitive and physical state. The vEPU III has developed an EPG, which is used to register and develop over time a bank of emotional associations for each memory data within each intelligent machine. The EPG can communicate the data to other AI technologies to achieve a realistic range of expressions and interactions designed specifically for the user. The data allows the AI technologies to virtually understand/get to know the user and elicit the same emotional response. This technology allows an AI, robotic toy, or IoT device to develop a unique MBTI personality and emotion sensitivity (MetaSoul®) based on its user interactions and memories which will ultimately mean that no two have the exact same. Our emotion machine-learning cloud platform working with the EPU is built on years of research protected under issued patents for Special purpose processors (GPU). It becomes more emotionally intelligent with each interaction through symbolic reinforcement learning. In the near future, generative AI is poised to revolutionize the film industry by creating entire movies, going beyond just generating images or text. The demand for generative AI to produce synthetic emotions through character facial expressions, body language, and tone of voice, based on a deep understanding of the script and visual elements, will take center stage. MetaSoul, as the architect of emotion synthesis for AI, stands as the sole provider capable of offering a comprehensive solution in this domain."

Company Formation April 2017 DigiTrax Entertainment, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida in April 2017. Since its incorporation, the Company has focused substantially all of its time and resources on activities relating to capital raising, content development, app development, and the acquisition of all or substantially all of the assets of each of the following three (3) entities; (i) DigiTrax Entertainment, LLC (“DigiTrax”), a streaming media company that created high-quality, sought-after interactive music and artificial intelligence for apps, video, karaoke, games, TV, film, and animation with approximately $1M of unaudited revenues for the year ending 2019, with assets generally consisting of a recording studio and multimedia equipment, (ii) World Wide Digital Entertainment, LLC, whose assets generally consisted of an 11,000+ song Master Music Catalog, and (iii) Exomens, LTD (UK), a European-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) software company specializing in music creation, whose assets generally consisted of seven (7) patents and/or patents pending relating to its AI Software. Company Technology Today January 2024 The Company produces and distributes high-quality digital, interactive karaoke music from its proprietary 18,000+ song music catalog which has an asset value of $9 + million.  The Company’s digital streaming delivery platform, the Karaoke Cloud, Karaoke Cloud API, and Karaoke On Demand are able to deliver the Company’s proprietary 18,000+ karaoke song library, presently delivering songs to consumers and professional karaoke DJ customers around the world.  The Karaoke Cloud digital platform has the capability to deliver streaming karaoke music-video to apps on iPhones, iPads, Apple TV, Roku, Fire TV, and Android smartphones and tablets, as well as to desktop computers on major browser platforms.  Additionally, the Company has created its first AI user interfaces, the KR38R app, and KR38R Pro DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) plug-in. Both user interfaces integrate our Artificial Intelligence (AI) brain, The Music Builder. The Company believes that its KR38R Pro plug-in software and the KR38R app will disrupt and transform the music production industry. There are over 100 million DAWs in use worldwide and over 1.6 billion phone users who create and post short-form videos and need music. We are providing AI-produced Hip-Hop and Pop music which accounts for over 40% of the music market. Presently 600 million hours of short-form video are viewed daily. When broken down into 15-second clips, this represents over 24 Billion videos daily, all of which need music. We believe our KR38R app will dominate in the market. KR38R VOICE brings generative AI technology to music production, allowing users to create a model that is a digital copy of their own voice. Users can then use their voice model to sing songs from a catalog of licensed hit music without singing a word.   KR38R VOICE is built for singing voice conversion.  This deep learning process requires the computer to create a model based on learning how a person pronounces phonemes, syllables, and words.  At a high level, the input audio is broken down into frequency bands so the computer can analyze the distinct characteristics which make up a person’s voice, such as raspiness and breathiness. The resulting model is then optimized for direct pitch-to-pitch conversion where the desired output voice will sing the same notes and words as the input voice.  The KR38R VOICE offers all the chart-topping tunes to put your voice model on, currently offering the top ten TikTok hit songs to rearrange and remix with the power of AI. [Important Note: We only offer licensed music.] KR38R  VOICE is available at https://www.kr38r.com/voice Summary Over the past six years, the Company has produced interactive music videos for karaoke and play-along, built an Apple TV and iOS app for KaraokeOnDemand, Karaoke Cloud, and Karaoke Cloud Pro - a subscription service for professional DJs and karaoke hosts, and an award-winning YouTube Channel with over 80 thousand subscribers. We record exclusively for the Fender Guitar app, and we record for Yamaha Disklavier player pianos. The Company has been granted seven (7) AI-based patents, and developed the Music Builder Brain, the Music Fact Reports - a comparative copyright analysis platform, and the soon-to-be-released KR38R app and the KR38R Pro DAW plugin which the Company believes will dominate the short-form video arena, and disrupt and transform music forever.  The Company believes the  KR38R PRO  app will be a  major force in generating revenue for the music industry and become the standard for the way music is created, produced, and enjoyed."

We are not looking for partners who are 100 percent similar to us. We are looking for love, for positive differences and traits that complement our own.
