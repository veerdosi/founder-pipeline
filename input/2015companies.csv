We have an innovative solution that flips the script on the usual question “what makes people leave?”, and instead asks “what makes people stay?”.  We’ve built a platform specifically designed to make it easier for organizations to create a workplace where people want to stay.  With our solution, healthcare organizations are better able to:  * know your people, and build strong relationships with them  * Reduce friction/frustration in clinician’s workflow by eliminating wasteful administrative tasks * support your people more effectively in their career development ** All while dramatically reducing the amount of time your clinicians and your administrative team is spending on manual data entry and paper pushing. **  How We Do It:  DoorSpace’s SaaS platform provides an intelligent data management system, enabling clinicians and their employers to collaborate, manage and maintain mission-critical personnel data.  DoorSpace provides a “single source of truth” that is updated in real-time across the organization each time an employee’s data file changes. We provide organizations with the workforce data they need to make data-driven decisions, and we reduce the time high-value talent is spending on low-value administrative tasks.  The immediate value DoorSpace provides our customers is that we clean up a lot of back office ""clutter"", automating the ongoing organization and maintenance of personnel data and documents.  The long term value DoorSpace provides to healthcare leaders is transparency across their workforce with real-time reporting and superior data accuracy, enabling better, faster decisions.  Specific Pain Points We Address:    * Clinicians and administrators wasting valuable time pushing paper and manually moving data from one silo’d system to another;    * Healthcare leaders wait months to get reports on the state of their workforce, delaying the resolution of serious problems until after impacted clinicians have quit;    * Inability to quickly identify clinician’s strengths and weaknesses to ensure strengths are leveraged while bolstering weaknesses with the right training;    * Delays that are weeks and often months long in getting things done - from placing a new clinician to billing insurance companies and every step along the way, back office inefficiencies      are costing organizations time and money they can’t afford to spend;   * Employers need to both ramp up recruiting to keep staff - ratios, and they need to increase investment in retention with limited resources;    * Growing turnover and no insights or clear strategic retention plan beyond paying clinicians more money;   * Growing frustration among clinicians, especially doctors and nurses, which has led to an increase in medical errors, nurse strikes, turnover, and disengagement from patient care work;"

The promise of autonomous vehicles depends on high-performance, all-weather, low-cost and scalable perception technology, and Oculii is bringing it to the world.  Oculii's AI software amplifies the resolution of any radar platform, enabling high performance perception for the next generation of autonomous systems. Traditional phased array radars have been used for decades and follow a strict size for performance tradeoff - the larger the sensor aperture, the higher the angular resolution. Oculii’s Virtual Aperture Imaging radar technology fundamentally breaks this tradeoff - enabling its sensors to trade increased compute/processing for angular resolution enhancement with the same physical aperture. Leveraging this technique enables Oculii sensors to extract unprecedented accuracy, range, and 4D positioning information from commodity off the shelf low-cost radar elements, bringing high resolution radar imaging to the next frontier.  Oculii is backed by some of the top investors and corporations from Silicon Valley, and is working with the leaders in Self Driving Vehicles, Robotics, and Drones - helping them deliver on an autonomous future with an advanced, robust, affordable perception platform."

The level of understanding of our human-like AI goes well beyond what standard physics-based approaches can deliver, including information that can’t be gained any other way. Importantly, in addition to increased safety, we enable a much more natural and smooth human-like driving of L4/5 autonomous vehicles. This is essential for autonomous vehicles to be accepted into a human-dominated road environment and also by passengers of robotaxi services. Without this capability autonomous vehicles simply will not function well enough. Perceptive Automata is working with OEMs, suppliers, and tech companies that are building or integrating ADAS and autonomous driving systems. The team is comprised of Harvard, MIT, and Stanford neuroscientists and AI experts working out of offices in Boston and Silicon Valley."

We do the heavy lifting with machine learning and computer vision to ensure untrained individuals have captured the right content and that it is of a diagnosable quality prior to transmission. We have built our solution to ensure that we can capture non-adherent patients where they already are by deskilling the process and improving accessibility for the most rural, impoverished, and marginalized populations. We've made it profitable to prevent diseases for the most at-risk Americans Business Overview:  Insight Optics empowers primary care providers (PCPs) to record and refer preventative pre-screening videos to local specialists for assisted diagnostics. Our goal is to enable PCPs to efficiently detect early signs of preventable diseases before permanent damage is done. We accomplish this by providing PCPs a platform to connect and send patient data to local specialists. This allows both users to monetize otherwise unrealized referral incentives and provide better care. Problem: Over 154 million patients in the United States are recommended for an annual retinal exam, especially those with a history of diabetes or high blood pressure. Unfortunately, less than 50% of this population will receive their screening due to the difficulty of visiting a specialist, lack of education or available specialists. However, most of these patients do see PCPs annually.   Solution: We’ve developed a telemedicine PaaS, enabling PCPs to record and refer retinal exams to local specialists for assisted review. PCPs create a new revenue stream through reimbursements and government incentives. Specialists find qualified leads and increase their screening capacity without the need for in-person appointments in a non-adherent population. Benefits: The OptoView system acts as a new revenue stream for both PCPs and specialists through reimbursement. The tool satisfies HEDIS requirements for PCPs and acts as a lead generation tool for specialists to find new patients. Annual reports determine whether managed care organizations receive reimbursements or penalties from state and federal agencies. Our application is designed to satisfy the requirements for annual diabetic eye screenings, increasing an organization’s compliance rates and ophthalmologists prioritize sick patients."
