Our flagship product, Lumexa, is an AI agent that learns to automate any repetitive task on a PC by simply watching a user perform it once. Problem Every year, businesses lose trillions of dollars and millions of human hours to digital busywork—the repetitive, mundane tasks that drain creativity and stifle growth. Despite an explosion in software tools, teams are more burdened than ever by manual data entry, cross-app reporting, and routine administrative cycles. Existing automation solutions are either too complex and expensive (legacy RPA) or too limited (API-based tools) to solve the problem for the vast majority of modern, agile businesses. Market This ""productivity paradox"" is most acute for the millions of solo founders, small teams, and agile SaaS companies that form the backbone of the new economy. For them, operational drag isn't just an annoyance; it's a critical bottleneck. They lack the dedicated IT departments and deep technical expertise required to deploy traditional automation, leaving their most valuable team members—including the founders themselves—trapped in work they hate. This represents a massive, underserved market hungry for a new solution. Solution Introducing Lumexa, from Marvis—an AI teammate you train as you would a new employee. Lumexa learns by watching. Simply perform a task on your PC once, and our AI agent learns the workflow, from simple copy-pasting to complex, multi-app processes. It then executes that task flawlessly and securely, whenever you need it. This is not another brittle RPA or a limited low-code platform. Lumexa is a new generation of AI that: Learns Visually: No coding, no complex flowcharts. If you can do the task, you can teach Lumexa. ""See. Learn. Done."" Is Hyper-Personalized: It automates your unique workflows across your specific stack of desktop and web applications. Delivers Instant Value: Beta users are already saving 15+ hours per week, reclaiming critical time to focus on product development, customer engagement, and strategic growth. Marvis is giving teams their most valuable resource back: time. With Lumexa, we empower businesses to achieve a new level of operational efficiency. Lumexa is currently in an exclusive free beta from Marvis, onboarding innovative SaaS companies and small businesses daily. We are building the operating system for a new era of human-machine collaboration, empowering teams to achieve unprecedented levels of productivity."

Key Features: PII Leak Vulnerability Detection: Proactively identify and address vulnerabilities where sensitive data (e.g., PII, PHI, and CHD) is exposed in plaintext through logs, files, tokens, cookies, or third-party systems (overlooked by SAST scanners). Compliance Automation: Automated Data Mapping: Know exactly where PII is handled within your codebases. Reporting & Data Flow Visualization: Continuously track and visualize sensitive data flows across storage mediums and third-party integrations, effortlessly generating Records of Processing Activities (RoPA) reports. Stay Ahead of Compliance Violations: Detect data processing agreement (DPA) breaches caused by overshared PII with third-party integrations before production."

We solve this by centralizing, analyzing, and unlocking the value of IP. Our platform organizes intangible assets in a structured system, providing AI-powered insights, portfolio-wide reporting, and enterprise-grade security to ensure businesses fully understand what they own and how it drives growth. Unlike traditional IP management tools that focus on legal case tracking, Big Idea connects IP to business strategy—helping companies make smarter, data-driven decisions. Our Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) AI extracts key insights from scattered IP data, while blockchain tracking ensures transparency and protection. With a fast-growing market and rising concerns about IP security, businesses need a modern, intelligence-driven solution. Big Idea gives executives and IP teams real-time clarity, helping them protect, manage, and monetize their most strategic assets. The future of IP isn’t just about legal management—it’s about intelligent decision-making, and Big Idea is leading the way."

By combining an intuitive drag-and-drop, no-code interface with powerful AI automation, doFlo empowers businesses to streamline processes while keeping humans in control. Inspired by process-mapping tools like Lucidchart, the platform turns simple annotations into fully functional automations, bridging the gap between AI’s vast potential and real-world usability. Unlike traditional workflow automation tools, doFlo is reliable, scalable, and built for real adoption, ensuring that AI enhances human productivity rather than replacing it. The demand for AI-powered automation is skyrocketing, but existing solutions are either too complex or too rigid to meet real business needs. doFlo was built to solve this problem by making AI workflows easy, accessible, and adaptable—starting with real estate and expanding into other industries. With 2,500+ integrations and proprietary AI models, the platform enables professionals to automate multi-step tasks without technical expertise, delivering efficiency while maintaining full transparency and data control at every step. AI workflows are just the beginning. The next seismic shift in automation is Agentic AI—AI systems that not only execute tasks but also learn, adapt, and act autonomously. doFlo is strategically positioning itself to lead this evolution, incorporating AI agent capabilities as market demand matures. This includes integrating LLM-powered decision-making, capturing rich meta-data for continuous learning, and expanding autonomous action capabilities. While many automation companies struggle to pivot toward AI agents due to legacy constraints, doFlo was built from the ground up to evolve alongside AI advancements. Founded by William Butler (CEO) and Thomas Maarseveen (CTO), doFlo is backed by a team with a proven track record in gaming, hardware, consumer, SaaS, and AI-driven businesses. Over 14 years, they’ve successfully launched and scaled multiple ventures, including an online gaming company that reached millions in ARR, and a cybersecurity startup acquired by Gen (formerly Avast) in a Fortune 500 exit. Their experience in building and scaling technology companies positions doFlo as a leader in the next wave of AI-powered automation. At its core, doFlo is driven by a simple belief: automation should empower people, not replace them. By eliminating repetitive tasks, businesses can unlock human creativity, deepen connections, and drive real innovation. As AI continues to evolve, doFlo is committed to ensuring it remains a force for good, creating technology that enhances human potential rather than diminishing it."

It exposes, harnesses, institutionalizes, and activates that intelligence to optimize predictive brand experiences and drive revenue at scale. Brands know who purchased what, when, where, and how it happened but are no closer to understanding “why it happened.” We unlock and unleash differentiated, zero-party data to tell brands why customers do what they do. This intelligence is the holy grail - the new oil. We access it by activating hyperpersonal human relationships between brands and their most important customers. We fuse 1:1 engagement and immersive omnichannel e-commerce experiences with powerful behavioral and social science-based BLMs (brand language models) to build meaningful and lasting customer-brand relationships.  At its core, our business is about re-establishing the economic value of human connection by combining old-world values with new-world capabilities. Our proprietary BLMs deliver differentiated data built on trust, empathy, care, and anticipation. Through livestream video, voice, text, and chat, they capture the emotional and irrational behavior wrapped in the human experience. With these insights, our billion-person corner store promises to know what consumers want before they know it themselves.  Umego is more than technology. It’s a declaration of principles - that authentic human relationships trump synthetic ones to propel meaningful and sustainable business growth. It confirms a fundamental truth: ●	Customers want someone who cares about them.  ●	Brands want retention, loyalty, and advocacy.  Umego delivers both."
