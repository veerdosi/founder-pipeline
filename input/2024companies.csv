Our platform uses cutting-edge AI and blockchain technology to automate personal data updates, streamline address changes, and empower users to control how their data is shared. As our lives become increasingly digital, managing your ‘digital DNA’ has never been more critical.

Yet, much of this data is fragmented across different platforms—financial institutions, healthcare providers, subscription services, and more. JunkDNA.AI brings order to this complexity, offering a secure, decentralized Web3 wallet where users can manage their evolving digital identities with ease. Our mission is to provide a seamless and secure experience for individuals and businesses alike, making the process of updating and protecting your digital footprint intuitive and automated.
